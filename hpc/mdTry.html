<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><span style="color:red">Markdown</span> is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for 
web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write 
plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).</p>

<p>Thus, "Markdown" is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a 
software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to 
HTML. See the <a href="/projects/markdown/syntax">Syntax</a> page for details pertaining to Markdown's formatting 
syntax. You can try it out, right now, using the online <a href="/projects/markdown/dingus">Dingus</a>.</p>

<p>The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as 
readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be 
publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up 
with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown's syntax has been 
influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source 
of inspiration for Markdown's syntax is the format of plain text email.</p>
