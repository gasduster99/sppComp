# Introduction

* I am Nick

* describe the california spp comps. port sampling data for modeling 

* describe our modeling efforts for estimating ssp comps.

# MCATs in Time

* **Top Panel:** Number of samples in rockfish market categories (1978-2015)
	
	* Colors represent different market categories
	* Thickness shows the number of samples

* **Bottom Panel:** Number of rockfish market categories
	
	* Count the colors
	* ~20 mcats in the late 70s
	* ~50 mcats in the recent times

* **Middle Panel:** Average number of samples per stratum
	
	* Find samples for each stratum (mcat, gear, port, year, qtr)
	* Average them

* 1978-1982 

* 1983-1990

# 78-82 Bars

* **Top Panel:** 
	
	* For each market category accounting for 99% of landings  
		* (blue) Proportion landings by weight
		* (red) Proportion samples by #

* **Bottom Panel:** Aggregated Species Compositions
	* Colors represent 13 select species (others grey)
	* Number above is the # species present
	* Hatching is MCAT nominal species 

* MCATs not pure
	* often nominal species is not even the major species
		* BCAC
		* BRWN

* Sampling Opportunistic
	* Sampling co-occurs with landings
	* Often as more species are present there are more samples
	* This is lucky for modeling
		* More samples than parameters (largely driven by spp)
		* Most landings are modeled (78-82: 96.8%)

* No sampling south of Conception

# 83-90 Bars

* Same picture but 83-90
	
	* (blue) Proportion landings by weight
	* (red) Proportion samples by #
	* Aggregated Species Compositions

* Top 99% of landings in more market categories
	
	* MCATs still largely impure

* 83-90: 98.3% of landings modeled

# Likelihood Forms

* First modeling choice: Pick a Likelihood

* Shelton etal. 2012 Fit Multinomial via the Multinomial-Poisson trans.
	
	* Piece together independent Poissons

* We are not limited to Multinomial distribution
	
	* quantify uncertainty (residual variability)
	* consider modeling overdispersion
	* additional parameter ($\phi$) to disentangle mean from variance

* $y_{ij}$: $i^{\text{th}}$ sample of the $j^{\text{th}}$ species' integer
weight

* Remove all other modeling decisions by modeling a single stratum
	
	* MCAT 250
	* Montery
	* Trawl
	* 1982/Q2

# Likelihood Graphs

* Fit models and look are how they predict

* **Left Pannel:** 95% HDI from each model along side observed sppComp data

	* black horizontal lines are observed species comps
	* blue is Possion (i.e. Multinomial) Model
	* red is Binomial
	* green is the Negative Binomial Model
	* yellow is the Beta-binomial Model

* **Right Panel:** Entire Beta-binomial predictive distribution

* Overdispersion is present (spp comps from [0,1])

* ~50 obsevations => 2.5 missing in 95% interval

	* Maybe NB missing a few to many, and BB missing a few to few
	* BB certaintly finding the most variance
	* split intervals but... very appropriate density

# Likelihood Table

* Consider MSE, DIC, WAIC, and Marginal Likelihood Bayesian Model Prob.

* Varied model selection criterion (Nothing is perfect!) 

* Consistent and large support for the Overdispersion Models
	
	* Most support for BB

* Moving forward I develop the BB model   

# Beta-Binomial Model

* A Full Operationalized Model!

* $y_{ijklm\eta}$: $i^{\text{th}}$ sample of the $j^{\text{th}}$ species' integer weight, in the $k^{\text{th}}$ port, caught with the $l^{\text{th}}$ gear, in the $\eta^{\text{th}}$ \mbox{quarter,} of year $m$, for a particular market \mbox{category.}

* Stratum $\mu$ linked to $\theta$ and observed cluster size ($n$) 

* Stratum $\sigma^2$ is largely a function of $\mu$ but with overdispersion $\rho$
	
	* $\rho\rightarrow0$: Binomial variance
	* $\rho\rightarrow1$: $n$ times Binomial variance

* Modeling of $\theta$ (all predictors are categorical):
	
	* Intercept
	* Additive offsets for: Species, Port, Gear
	* Consider multiple time models

\clearpage

# Time Models

* Bayesian Modeling 
	* Heirarchical v. Random Effect Disclaimer

* (M1) Fixed main effect time model
	
	* No pooling

* (M2) Random main effect time model
	
	* years/quarter pool separately

* (M3) Random main effects + random interaction

* (M4) Random interactions jointly pooled

* (M5) Random interactions quarterly variances pooling across years

* (M6) Random interactions yearly variances pooling across quarters 

# Priors

* Very diffuse priors

* Main effects diffuse Normals

* $\rho$ transformed to be a real number

	* $\text{logit}(\rho) \rightarrow (-3.91, 3.91)$
	* $\rho \rightarrow (0.02, 0.98)$  

* Any heirarchical variance gets the same IG prior
	
	* Considered others:
		* $\sqrt{v}~$~ Half-Cauchy$(10^{-2})$
		* $\sqrt{v}~$~ Unif$(0, 10^5)$

\clearpage

# Beta-Binomial Fits

* Fit model separately in 78-82 and 83-90 and compare model selection criterion

* 78-82:

	* Consistent support for more pooling
	* All measures point to (M4)

* 83-90:
	
	* Consistent support for interaction models
	* Uncertainty between (M3), (M4), and (M5)
	* Lesser support for (M6)

* We fit model (M4) everywhere
	
	* Stable and relatively fast model to fit
	* Given its support in 78-82, I am drawn to (M4)
		* Each time period seems to have a mind of its own  
\begin{eqnarray*}
&\beta^{(t)}_{m\eta} = \beta^{(y)}_{m} + \beta^{(q)}_{\eta} + \beta^{(y:q)}_{m\eta} & \\
&\beta^{(y)}_{m} \sim N(0, 32) & \\
&\beta^{(q)}_{\eta} \sim N(0, 32) & \\
&\beta^{(y:q)}_{m\eta} \sim N(0, v) &
\end{eqnarray*}

# Posterior Predictive Species Comps.

* Having settled on (M4) in both time periods, how do we build species comps?

* Inference results in samples from posterior distribution $P\Big(\mu_{jklm\eta}, \sigma^2_{jklm\eta} | y\Big)$

* Run samples back through BB likelihood to compute Monte Carlo integral and get posterior predictive distribution of sampled weight.

* Use draws from model posterior predictive weight to compute species comp. distribution
	
	* Plot shows average species compositions 
	* Full distribution for $y^*$ as well as $\pi^*$
	* Each sample sums to 1 and $\sum_j\mathbb{E}[\pi^*_j]$=1

* By adding an unobserved latent time period we can make out-of-sample predictions
	* (M4): unobserved $\beta^{(y)^*}$ and $\beta^{(q)^*}$

# Single Quarter Hindcast

* Recall for 1978-1982 there was no sampling south of point conception.

* Adding an unobserved year and quarter

	* make predictions for each species in each combo of: 
		* three observed gear groups 
		* three southern port complexes

\clearpage

# 78-82 Prediction

* Modeled MCATs

* MCATs in the rows **(ordered by landings)** w/ 3 nominal HDI prediction levels

	* For each stratum of each MCAT compare data to prediction intervals
	* Observed level should match Nomial
	* Prediction higher than nominal => Overfitting
	* Prediction lower => Underfitting (not enough residual variance) 
	
* Most do well
	* Average performance is reasonable
	* Note this is a unweighted, simple, average
	* More accurate would weight average by samples at each stratum 

* Particularly well in heavily landed stratum

	* correlation of sampling effort w/ landings

* Widow is a wild child
	* only example that is off by more than 5% points at any level

# 83-90 Prediction

* Same Table
	* Modeled MCATs **(ordered by landings)** w/ 3 nominal pred. levels

* Again most do well

* Recall landings were spread across more MCATs in 83-90
	* Enough samples to also model more MCATs

* Blackgill, Yellowtail, Cowcod: off by 5% points at some level
	* Negligable Landings

# Speciating Landings

* $\lambda_{\cdot klm\eta}$ is reported on landing reciepts

* $\lambda^*_{jklm\eta}$ stored in DB

* Aggregate to any level
	
	* across quarter, port complex, gear group
	* Also MCAT (I ran out of index variables :/)

* E.J. will show the speciated time series with predictive intervals 
	
	* summed across MCAT
	* as it might be used in asessment

\clearpage

# BMA Story

* Mentioned partial pooling thru time via heirarchical modeling

* But present system also pools in space
	* Given sparcity, it's entirely possible that we also need spatial pooling 

* I show MSE to demonstrate the biase/variance trade off
	
	* Pooling directly exchanges sample size (postior variance) with bias
	* **Far Right** Least Bias
	* **Far Left** Most Bias, but most data for small posterior variance
	* A practicle solution is somewhere in between

* [Bell number] Idea: Try all partions of port complexes

* $\text{B}_{10}=115975$
	
	* Too many
	* add Spatial Modeling Constraints 
	* Biogeography viewed through the lens of human behavior
		* sampling behavior
		* fisherman behavior

* $\bar{\text{B}}_{10}=61136$
	
	* Require partitions to be "small"
	* No super-grouping greater than 3 port complexes
	* points close in space behave similarly (smoothness)

* $\hat{\text{B}}_{10}=512$
	
	* Require continuous partitions (no leap frogging)
	* Like a GP continunity constraint

* $\hat{\bar{\text{B}}}_{10}=274$

	* Together we have "small" and "continuous" partitions
	* smoothness and continuity 
	* a computationally manageable set of models to compute

\clearpage

# BMA Math
	
* Defines a candidate model set

* We could just pick the single "best" model

	* defining "best" is hard
	* model selection criterion are imperfect 

* Prediction results are averaged results

# 78-82 BMA Results

* Describe plot

* Recall no sampling in the south
	* All latent structure filled in by predictive distribution in the south

* 250:
	* Marginal model probability 
		* N1: 32+14+13+12=71%
		* N2: 2+2+2+2=8%

* 253:
	* Central Block
	* BRG/BDG
	* Lump/Split CRS and ERK (among top 5 models; 58% model weight)
		* Split: 0.3448276
		* Lump: 0.6551724

* 269:
	* Sold on the BRG-BDG break

\clearpage

# 83-90 BMA Results

* Recall BRG-OSF Missing data

* 250:
	
	* Missing data story
		* Lump or
		* Quarantine	

* 956:
	
	* Lump/Split CRS and ERK
	* A break at Cape Mendicino
	* BRG/BDG/OSF Quarantine os missing data

* 269:
	
	* Piont Conception Break
	* Cape Mendicino Break
