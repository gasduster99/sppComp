# Introduction

* I am Nick
* describe the california spp comps. port sampling data for modeling 
* describe our modeling efforts for estimating ssp comps.

# MCATS in Time

* **Top Panel:** Number of samples in rockfish market categories (1978-2015)
	* Colors represent different market categories
	* Thickness shows the number of samples
* **Bottom Panel:** Number of rockfish market categories
	* Count the colors
	* ~20 mcats in the late 70s
	* ~50 mcats in the recent times
* **Middle Panel:** Average number of samples per stratum
	* Find samples for each stratum (mcat, gear, port, year, qtr)
	* Average them
* 1978-1982 
* 1983-1990

# 78-82 Bars

* **Top Panel:** 
	* For each market category  
		* Proportion landings by weight (blue)
		* Proportion samples by # (red)
* **Bottom Panel:** Aggregated Species Compositions
	* Colors represent species
	* Number above is the # species present
	* Hatching is MCAT nominal species 

* Sampling Opportunistic
	* Sampling co-occurs with landings
	* Often as more species are present there are more samples
	* This is lucky for modeling
		* Most landings are modeled
			* 78-82: 96.8% 
			* 83-90: 98.3%
