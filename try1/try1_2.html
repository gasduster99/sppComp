# Abstract

Effective management of exploited fish populations, requires accurate estimates 
of commercial fisheries catches to inform monitoring and assessment efforts. 
In California, the high degree of heterogeneity in the species composition of 
many groundfish fisheries, particularly those targeting rockfish 
(genus $Sebastes$), leads to challenges in sampling all potential strata, or 
species, adequately. Limited resources and increasingly complex stratification 
of the sampling system inevitably leads to gaps in sample data. 
In the presence of sampling gaps, ad-hoc species composition point estimation 
is currently obtained according to historically derived “data borrowing” 
(imputation) protocols which do not allow for uncertainty estimation or 
forecasting. In order to move from the current ad-hoc “data-borrowing” 
point estimators, we have constructed Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate 
species compositions, complete with accurate measures of uncertainty, as well 
as theoretically sound out-of-sample predictions. Furthermore, we introduce a 
computational method for discovering consistent “borrowing” strategies 
across over-stratified data. Our modeling approach, along with a 
computationally robust system of inference and model exploration, allows us to 
start to understand the effect of the highly stratified, and sparse, sampling 
system on the kinds of inference possible, while simultaneously making the 
most from the available data.

# Significance

In order to understand how fish populations respond to fishing, it is critical 
to obtain accurate estimates of how many fish are removed from the ocean 
(catch) and to quantify the precision of those estimates. Traditionally, 
population dynamics models used to measure this response to fishing (“stock 
assessments”) are conditioned on a time series of annual catches. These catch 
estimates are often treated as being known without error, despite the fact 
that they are derived from sampling programs that estimate the proportion of 
unsampled strata must be “filled in” through a process sometimes referred 
to on the U.S. West Coast as “borrowing” (i.e. data imputation). Historically, 
methods used to “borrow” information among strata have been different species 
found within multiple sampling strata.Sampling error introduces uncertainty 
into estimates of the catch, and ad-hoc in nature and driven by expert opinion 
of local managers (Sen et al. 1984, 1986) (Pearson and Erwin  1997). We seek 
to improve upon this practice through development of a model-based approach 
that provides estimates of catch and associated uncertainty, as well as an 
objective, defensible framework for model selection and data imputation. 
Although the theoretical basis for a model based estimation of species 
composition in mixed stock fisheries has been advanced (Shelton et al., 2012), 
it has not yet been implemented successfully using actual historical or 
contemporary data.

![Spase Data](./pictures/sampleComplex.png)

The difficulties associated with the existing ad-hoc approach are magnified by 
an increase in the number of sampling strata over time, specifically the 
number of “market categories,” into which fishermen and dealers sort their 
catch (Figure 1, Bottom). The increase in the number of market categories 
(sampling strata) has not been matched by increases in sampling effort, 
resulting in a decline in the average number of samples per stratum (Figure 1, 
Middle). In other words, data are becoming more sparse, increasing our 
uncertainty in estimates of catch. Since the data are also stratified over a 
number of ports, fishing gear types, years, and quarters, inference is not 
possible without some sort of stratum pooling. Rather than rely so heavily on 
the previous, ad-hoc pooling rules which change based on the availability of 
samples, we hope to standardize any necessary pooling through an exhaustive 
search of the space (possible configurations) of pooled models. Pooling (and 
partial pooling) among strata is achieved using Bayesian hierarchical 
statistical models and model averaging (Gelman et al., 2014).

<!--simple form experiment explain-->
<p>Something something heirarchical poisson model. Something something (Shelton, 2012).</p>
<p>For the purposes of accuratly modeling not only species composition means, but also higher moments of the data, such as species composition variances, it is neccisary to recognize model limitations with respect to over-dispersed data. Amoung the simplest models for count data are the poisson and binomial models. Both models are typically specificed with a single degree of freedom for modeling all of the moments of the data, and thus they rely heavily on their respective data generating processes to accuratly represent higher moments in the data. McCullagh and Nelder (1989, pg. 124) commiserate about the prevalence of over-dispersed data in cluster sampling, and explain ways in which cluster sampling itself may result in over-dispersion.</p>
<p>Extending the Poisson and binomial models to deal with over-dispersion, typically involves adding additional parameters for the purpose of modeling higher moments of the data. The negative binomial (NB) distribution is often used as an over-dispersed extension of the poisson model, since it can be expressly written as an infite mixture of poisson distributions. While the beta-binomial model is typically used to as an over-dispersed extension of the binomial model.</p>

<p>To discern between these discrete modeling options we consider a small scale example of the Poisson, binomial, negative binomial, and beta-binomial models fit to the port sampling integer weight data from market category 250, in the Montery port complex trawl fishery in 1982. <span class="math inline">(<em>a</em><em>n</em><em>y</em><em>w</em><em>i</em><em>l</em><em>l</em><em>w</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>k</em>)</span> This stratum was visited 32 times by port samplers, collecting a total of 59 <!--38 times by port samplers, collecting a total of 67--> cluster samples across 55 unique species. <!--344 model observations across 21 $(at least; URCK)$ unique species.--> Each of the above models are fit to these data.</p>
<p>The Poisson and binomial models attempt to model both the mean and residual variance of the data with a single parameter for each species. By definition these models have residual varinces which are tied to the species means. Simply estimating the mean parameters in these cases may not be sufficient to produce models which predict well.</p>
<p>In contrast, the negative binomial and beta-binomial models estimate an additional parameter which is can be used to disentangle the mean and residual variance estimates. Thus the negative binomial and beta-binomial models may produce more accurate estimates of the residual variance; in better modeling the variance, these models may often prduce more accurate estimates of the mean. <!--Thus it is possible that the negative binomial and--></p>

For brevity we only consider the most prevalent six species in this example (CLPR, BCAC, WDOW, BLGL, ARRA, BANK). Additionally, the MSE, DIC, WAIC, and Bayesian marginal likelyhood model probabilities are computed for each model as measures of model fit as seen in Table(1).</p>
<p>Table(1) show a clear preference for the overdispersed models, with the most overall support for the beta-binomial model. This initial result guides the use of the beta-binomial data generating model for the purposes of building a model to apply at an operational scale.</p>

<p>Firstly, <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> includes a reference level intercept (<span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub>0</sub></span>).

Finally year and quarter parameters are indicated generally here inside the <span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>m</em><em>η</em></sub><sup>(<em>t</em>)</sup></span> term. Several forms for <span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>m</em><em>η</em></sub><sup>(<em>t</em>)</sup></span> are explored each implying a different prior and partial pooling strategies as described in the following section(XX).</p>
<h2 id="priors">Priors</h2>
<p>To complete the bayesian formulation of this model, priors are expressed in a largly diffuse manner.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display"><em>β</em><sub>0</sub> ∝ 1</span><br /> <br /><span class="math display">{<em>β</em><sub><em>j</em></sub><sup>(<em>s</em>)</sup>,<em>β</em><sub><em>k</em></sub><sup>(<em>p</em>)</sup>,<em>β</em><sub><em>l</em></sub><sup>(<em>g</em>)</sup>} ∼ <em>N</em>(0, 32<sup>2</sup>)</span><br /></p>
<p>Since the <span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub>0</sub></span> reference level is choosen arbitarily, with no conception of which values it may take, no restrictions are placed on the value of the intercept. The species (<span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>j</em></sub><sup>(<em>s</em>)</sup></span>), port-complex (<span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>k</em></sub><sup>(<em>p</em>)</sup></span>), and gear-group (<span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>l</em></sub><sup>(<em>g</em>)</sup></span>) offests are assigned diffuse normal priors. The large fixed values of the prior variance hyperparameters produce behavior similar to classical fixed effect models for species, port-complex, and gear- group parameters.</p>
<p>In returning to the time parameter model, <span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>m</em><em>η</em></sub><sup>(<em>t</em>)</sup></span>, it is useful to consider how the inclusion of predictively superfluous parameters may cause overfitting and weaken model performance through the bias-variance dilemma (Ramasubramanian, K., &amp; Singh, A., 2016). Simply put, the bias-variance dilemma means that model formulation is not simply a bias reduction task, but rather the goal is to formulate models which reduce bias, while jointly minimizing uncertainty. Janyes (2003, pg. 511) describes how the inclusion of estimation bias via the Bayesian methodolgy may produce better performing estimates, more quickly, than unbiased counterparts.<br />
Amoung the simlest ways to see the principle is in the structure of the MSE performance metric, and how it can be explicitly written to value both estimator bias and variance, as follows.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\text{MSE}(\hat\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[~(\hat\theta - \theta)^2~\right] = \overbrace{\mathbb{E}\Big[~\left(\hat\theta-\mathbb{E}(\hat\theta)\right)^2~\Big]}^{\text{Var}(\hat \theta)} + \overbrace{\Big(~\mathbb{E}(\hat\theta)-\theta~\Big)^2}^{\text{Bias}(\hat \theta, \theta)^2}$$</span><br /></p>
<!--
Including additional model parameters is a great way to decrease model bias, 
however it is appearent from the structure of the MSE that decreasing model 
bias alone is not a good way of arriving at a well performing model. Models 
with good MSEs jointly minimize the bias of their parameter estimates, in 
addition to estimation uncertainty of their parameters. 
-->
<p>Furthermore a model can mimimize bias, without reguard for estimation uncertainty, by including one model parameter to be fit to each observation. These parameter estimates are totally unbiased, however such a model is also predictively usless since each estimated parameter is specifically bound to a<br />
particular observation, and thus such a model does not generalize. <!--has no information for which to base predictions on future data.--></p>

<p>(M3) functions similarly as (M2), in that it has heirarchical partial pooling among both the <span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>m</em></sub><sup>(<em>y</em>)</sup></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>η</em></sub><sup>(<em>q</em>)</sup></span> parameters, except that it intoduces a two-way interaction term between year and quarter. This interaction term allows estimates for particular quarters to differ from year to year, as opposed to the previous models in which quarters within a year are assumed to be identical from year to year.</p>
<p>Furthermore the <span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>m</em><em>η</em></sub><sup>(<em>y</em> : <em>q</em>)</sup></span> are also modeled heirarchically to introduce a single variance parameter, <span class="math inline"><em>v</em></span>, shared among all of the <span class="math inline"><em>m</em><em>η</em></span> time chunks.

<p>(M4) simplifies (M3) by excluding year and quarter main effects. This leaves all temporal information in the data to be modeled solely by the quarterly <span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>m</em><em>η</em></sub><sup>(<em>y</em> : <em>q</em>)</sup></span> interaction terms.

<p>(M6) follows the same idea as (M5), however here interaction terms are allowed to partially pool interactions within a common year, across the quarters of that year, but not between years.

<p>Heirarchical variance parameters are estimated from the data. As the above models learn the posteriors of the hierarchical variance parameters, it effects the degree of shrinkage as well as the effective number of parameters held within the respective heirarchies (Gelman, 2014). To achieve this, each variance parameter must itself be assigned a prior to be estimated.

The <span class="math inline"><em>N</em>(0, 2<sup>2</sup>)</span> prior is indeed a symmetric, and far reaching, prior when back transformed to the unit interval. To notice this, it is helpful to realize that the central 95% inverval for a <span class="math inline"><em>N</em>(0, 2<sup>2</sup>)</span> (i.e. <span class="math inline">0 ± 3.91</span>), includes almost the entirety of the back transformed unit interval (i.e. <span class="math inline">0.5 ± 0.48</span>).</p>

<p>Estimating model (M4) in a Bayesain way gives access to the full posterior distribution of all of the parameters of the model. It is useful to emphasize that in the Bayesian setting, these parameters have full distributions, and they are typically handeled as a large number of samples from the joint posterior distribution of the parameters. Once the posterior sampling is complete, this simplifies parameter mean and variance estimation since the required moments are simply obtainted by computing the desired moments from the posterior samples. Additionally the fact that the parameters are full distributions, means that any functions which contain, or are derived from, parameters are themselves random variables with the function representing a random variable transformation.</p>

<p>Port complex pooling is achieved by repeatedly fitting model (M4) with different partitionings of the port complex variables within a particular market category and modeling time period. This model exploration exercise explores the possible ways to produce groupings of the existing port complexes so as to discover predictively useful partionings of the port complexes.

period, port pooling is defined as some partion of the set of port complexes in

The brute force model selection strategy of computing all 115975 of these partitionings strategies is computationally infeasible. However, not all pooling schemes represent biologically relevant models. For example, perhaps it is reasonable to pool only among adjacent ports (i.e. no discontinuities between port complex pooling in space), or perhaps it is reasonable to assert that biologically similar regions can only extend across a small number of ports.</p>
<p>Here only adjacent port poolings are considered, such that the maximum size of a port complex grouping is three port complexes. These are the only two constraints that are enforced on port complex partitions here, although many other constraints may in theory be chosen. These constraints were chosen so as to mirror the currently accepted protocols in Pearson and Erwin (1997) within the context of this framework. When these two simple constraints are applied, the number of models to explore in each modeled period is reduced to a much more manageable 274 models.</p>

<p>The split beta-binomial intervals seen in Figure(1) are the consequence of confining a large amount of residual variability to the unit interval. The beta-binomial is the only model considered here, which estimates such a large degree of variablility and thus it is the only model that produces predictive species composition distributions of the sort. Figure(2) shows the beta-binomial predictive distributions as a violin plot demonstrating how the beta-binomial model arranges predictive density over the unit interval. The predictive intervals in Figure(1) are the smallest possible regions on each of these densities so that each intervals contain 95% probability. Species composition is bounded on [0, 1], thus in the presence of large variablity predictive density may aggragate around the bounds. For the example of STRK, notice that although the predictive HDI is split, the vast majority of density lies directly atop the data.</p>

The Poisson and binomial models attempt to model both the mean and 
residual variances with a single parameter for each species. This can tend to 
biase mean estimates, in overdispersed stratum, toward larger values, for the 
sake of estimating larger residual variances. Similarly variance estimates may 
tend to be biased toward smaller values for the sake of estimating smaller 
means.
-->
<!--
In contrast, the negative binomial and beta-binomial models estimate an 
additional parameter which is intended to disentangle the mean and residual 
variance estimates. Thus the negative binomial and beta-binomial models are 
able to produce more accurate estimates of both the mean and residual 
variance.

All of the measures in Table(1) consistently agree that the negative binomial

Depending 
on the users value system toward model selection (e.g. predictive or 
inferential), the support for the beta-binomial model over the negative 
binomial model may vary, but it is worth noting that the more robust model 
selction tools show stronger support for the beta-binomial model, with Bayesian

<p>Table(XX) displays the relative support for the model structure on the <span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>m</em><em>η</em></sub><sup>(<em>t</em>)</sup></span> time parameters.

<p>Across all of the time models, model M4 displays consistent support over all other candidate models considered here. Model M4 represents a model with maximal potential for pooling through time, while still maintaing the ability to model differences in seasonality from year to year.</p>
<!--
From M1 to M4 all model selection criterion consistently support the 
inclusion of heirarchical main effects on both year and quarter parmeters. 
As various model forms for interaction term are added in M5, M6, and M7 the 
data seem to support prior structures which involve the potential for a higher 
degree of partial pooling while still supporting the inclusion of year-quarter 
interactions. All moddel selection criterion agree that M5 shows the highest 
degree of support. Presumably M5 strikes a balance between maximal potential for 
heirarchical pooling, while still maintaing the ability to model differences in 
seasonality from year to year.

<p>As a final check of the model structure and the implied prior information the prior predictive is considered. The prior predictive distribution summarizes the information that is intrinsic to the model structure itself, in the absense of data. The prior predictive of modeled weight is considered over a 100 pound cluster size, which is consistent with aggregating the two nominal 50 pound cluster samples described by Sen (1984) in the original sampling protocol.</p>

<p>As seen in Figure(XX) the prior predictive of (M4) is both symmetric and quite diffuse over the 100 pound domain. The U shape of the distribution is a side effect of the diffusion of the selected prior. As data are added to the model, the indecisive U shape of this distribution collapses toward the data in the posterior.</p>

<!--
All of the measures in Table(1) consistently agree that the negative binomial 
and beta-binomial models out perform the overdispersed Poisson and binomial 
models. Furthermore, all of the metrics in Table(1) indicate that the beta-binomial model outperforms the negative binomial model. Depending 
on the users value system toward model selection (e.g. predictive or 
inferential), the support for the beta-binomial model over the negative 
binomial model may vary, but it is worth noting that the more robust model 
selction tools show stronger support for the beta-binomial model, with Bayesian 
model probabilities indicating practically conclusive support for the 
beta-binomial model. 

The split beta-binomial intervals seen in Figure(1) are the consequence of 
confining a large amount of residual variability to the unit interval. The 
beta-binomial is the only model considered here, which estimates such a 
large degree of variablility and thus it is the only model that produces 
predictive species composition distributions of the sort. Figure(2) shows the 
beta-binomial predictive distributions as a violin plot demonstrating how the
beta-binomial model arranges predictive density over the unit interval. The 
predictive intervals in Figure(1) are the smallest possible regions on each 
density so that the intervals contain 95% of the predictive density (i.e. 
these regions represent the densest packing of 95% probbaility under each 
predictive distribution). For the cases of Aurora and Bank rockfish, the 
empty upper regions seen in Figure(1) are understandable in terms of the 
relatively low density region of the posterior they represent, as seen in 
Figure(2).

Given observed overdispersion relative to the Poisson and Binomial 
distributions, the Beta-Binomial model makes use of a correlation parameter, 
$\rho$, to better model uncertainties, while maintaining a flexible model on 
stratum means through the linear predictor. The linear predictor parameters, 
$\theta$, are then factored as follows among the many strata,

$$\theta_{jklm\eta} = \beta_0 + \beta^{(s)}_j + \beta^{(p)}_k + \beta^{(g)}_l + \beta^{(y:q)}_{m\eta}.$$

As a Bayesian model, we specify any information external to the dataset, 
through our priors on the parameters, $p(\theta)$.Our priors are largely 
diffuse normals, representing relatively little prior information, producing 
behavior similar to classical fixed effect models on species 
($\beta^{(s)}_j$), port ($\beta^{(p)}_k$), and gear ($\beta^{(g)}_l$) 
parameters.Our priors on time parameters ($\beta^{(y:q)}_{m\eta}$) are modeled 
similarly to a classical random effects model, which uses the data to estimate 
a shared variance among all year-quarter interaction terms.Such a hierarchical 
prior thru time, imposes the prior information that data thru time share some 
degree of similarity, however the exact degree of similarity is not specified, 
rather the degree of similarity among time parameters is itself a parameter to 
be estimated from the data.In recent years, inference on these models has 
become faster and easier to compute through the use of computational Laplace 
approximations (Rue et al., 2009); we compute inferences on the above model in 
R (R Core Team, 2015) using the R-INLA package (Rue et al., 2013). 

## Species Composition

Applying the bayesian predictive framework to the above model gives the 
following expressions for predicted weight in each stratum,
$$p(y^*_{jklm\eta}|y) = \int\!\!\!\!\int\! \text{BB}\Big( y^*_{jklm\eta}|\theta_{jklm\eta}, \rho \Big) P\Big(\theta_{jklm\eta}, \rho | y\Big) d\theta_{jklm\eta} d\rho.$$
$p(y^*_{jklm\eta}|y)$ is computed via monte carlo integration and represents 
the model's full predictive distribution for the $j^{th}$ species' weight, in 
the $k^{th}$ port, caught with the $l^{th}$ gear, in the $\eta^{th}$ quarter, 
of year $m$.
Considering the same type of prediction across all species in a particular 
stratum allows for the calculation of predictive species composistions.
The following joint transformation of the species' predictive weights result 
in predictive species compositions, 
$$\pi^*_{jklm\eta} = \frac{y^*_{jklm\eta}}{\sum_j y^*_{jklm\eta}} ~~~ y^*_{klm\eta}\neq 0.$$
Because the $y^*$ are random variables, and $\pi^*$ is nothing more than a 
transformation of the $y^*$, $\pi^*$ is too a random variable. 
Furthermore once inference is complete, we can easily sample these 
distributions and compute any desired moments from these samples.

<!--
The straight-forward spatial model implied by the categorical port complex 
variables do not adequatly resolve in-sample prediction at the observed 
sample sizes. 
Presently these deminishingly small within stratum sample sizes are managed 
by an ad-hoc "borrowing" protocol outlined by Pearson and Erwin (1997).
We aim to formalize this "borrowing" idea via an exhaustive search of spatially 
pooled models, combined with the formalized process of Bayesian Model 
Averaging (BMA) to appropriatly integrate port-complex pooling model 
uncertainty into species composition estimates (Hoeting et al. , 1999).


The space of possible pooled models is well defined in terms of the size of 
the set of items to be partitioned, $K$, as described by the Bell numbers 
($B_K$), 
$$B_K=\sum_{\hat k=0}^{K} \frac{1}{\hat k!} \left( \sum_{j=0}^{\hat k} (-1)^{\hat k -j} \left(\substack{\hat k \\ j}\right) j^K \right).$$
The most straight-forward solution in the presence of this type of model 
uncertainty is to compute all $B_K$ possible pooling schemes.
However, maybe not all pooling schemes represent biologically relevant models.
For example, perhaps it is reasonable to pool only among adjacent ports, or to 
assert that biologically similar regions can only extend across a small number
of ports (if so, how many?).

Each of these hypotheses are easily represented as subsets of the total model 
space, $B_K$, as seen in Figure (2). An exhaustive search of the models in 
these subspaces, and a comparison of the relative predictive accuracy of each 
model, provides concrete quantitative support for, or against, each of these 
hypotheses. Through this technique of exhaustive search and measuring relative 
predictive accuracy, we are able to understand the system to a greater degree 
than before possible. Furthermore such an exhaustive search of these model 
spaces allows for even more accurate estimates of species composition, and 
uncertainty, through the use of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) among the 
candidate models.
Bayesian model averaging allows us to account for model uncertainty around 
these difficult modeling decisions, while combining the respective predictive 
capabilities of each model of a given subset of model space 
(Hoeting et al., 1999). 
Once all of the models of a given model space are computed, combining them to 
account for model uncertainty, through BMA, requires trivial computation time, 
but adds substantial robustness to our predictions.

BMA

Bayesian model averaging is straight forward. For the $\mu^{th}$ model, of 
model space $\mathbb{M}$, a straight forward implementation of Bayes theorem 
gives, 
$$Pr(\mathbb{M}_\mu|y) = \frac{ p(y|\mathbb{M}_\mu)p(\mathbb{M}_\mu) }{ \sum_\mu p(y|\mathbb{M}_\mu)p(\mathbb{M}_\mu) } = \omega_\mu$$
Where $\omega_\mu$ is the posterior probability that model $\mu$ is the true 
data generating model of the data, conditional on the subspace of candidate 
models and the observed data. $\omega_\mu$ is then straightforwardly used to 
average together the posteriors of all of the candidate models, as follows
$\bar p(\theta|y) = \sum_{\mu} \omega_\mu p(\theta|y, \mathbb{M}_\mu).$

NOTE: Lots of stratum: market category, port, gear, year, qtr. Data becoming more and more sparse. reframe figures.

In the present sample-based methodology, data is required in each unique stratification of the system to obtain any estimate.
Given the complex, and numerous, stratification of this system, many stratum do not have observations, and thus inference is not possible without some sort of stratum pooling.
Pooling data will naturally increase the bias of the resulting estimates, but when no other data is available, a slightly biased estimate is better than no estimate at all.
In the current state of affairs, a "historically" derived set of pooling rules have been implemented across ports when no other data is available.
The "historical" pooling rules are largely based on personal experience with the sampling process, although quantifiable evidence for the implemented rules have been hard to produce until recently.

# Technical Project Plan

## Model

For a particular market category, $y_{ijklm\eta}$ is the  $i^{th}$ sample of the $j^{th}$ species’ weight, in the $k^{th}$ port, caught with the $l^{th}$ gear, in the $\eta^{th}$ quarter, of year $m$.
In accordance with the typical model based statistical procedure, the $y_{ijklm\eta}$ are said to be observations from a statistical distribution $f$ conditional on some parameters $\theta$ and $\rho$.
$$y_{ijklm\eta} \sim f(y_{ijklm\eta}|\theta, \rho).$$
Given observed overdispersion relative to the Poisson and Binomial distributions, we have found the Beta-Binomial distribution to perform well as an observation model for these data.
The linear predictor parameters, $\theta$, are then factored as follows among the many stratum, 
$$\theta_{jklm\eta} = \beta_0 + \beta^{(s)}_j + \beta^{(p)}_k + \beta^{(g)}_l + \beta^{(y:q)}_{m\eta}.$$
$\rho$ is a correlation parameter among the stratum, which gives the Beta-Binomial added flexibility for modeling overdisperse data.

As a Bayesian model, we specify any information external to the dataset, thru our priors on the parameters, $p(\theta)$.
Our priors are largely diffuse normals, representing relatively little prior information, producing behavior similar to classical fixed effect models on species ($\beta^{(s)}_j$), port ($\beta^{(p)}_k$), and gear ($\beta^{(g)}_l$) parameters.
Our priors on time parameters ($\beta^{(y:q)}_{m\eta}$) are modeled similarly to a classical random effects model, which uses the data to estimate a shared variance among all year-quarter interaction terms.
Such a hierarchical prior thru time, imposes the prior information that data thru time share some degree of similarity, however the exact degree of similarity is not specified, rather the degree of similarity among time parameters is itself a parameter to be estimated from the data.

In the past such models have been difficult to fit, due to relatively slow, unparallelizable, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods of inference.
In recent years, inference on these models has become faster thru the use of computational Laplace approximations (Rue et al., 2009), as distributed thru the R-INLA package (Rue et al., 2013).
Of primary note, the INLA method of inference is largely parallelizable, and does not rely on the subjective process of determining Markov chain convergence.
Together the parallelizable and "hands-off" nature of INLA inference allows for automated model exploration.

## Model Exploration

<!--, or even beyond spatial parameters, into other stratum, or other difficult modeling decisions, as resources allow.-->
<!--
With the added ability to automate Bayesian model exploration, we desire to explore the space of pooled models with the hope of obtaining quantitative evidence of optimal pooling behavior in space.
Furthermore as resources allow, model exploration could easily extend across any other difficult modeling decisions which may represent significant sources of model uncertainty.
The space of possible pooled models is well defined in terms of the size of the set of items to be partitioned, $K$, as described by the Bell numbers ($B_K$),
$$B_K=\sum_{\hat k=0}^{K} \frac{1}{\hat k!} \left( \sum_{j=0}^{\hat k} (-1)^{\hat k -j} \left(\substack{\hat k \\ j}\right) j^K \right).$$
The most straight-forward solution in the presence of this type of model uncertainty is to simply compute all $B_K$ possible pooling schemes.
However, practically speaking, not all pooling schemes necessarily represent biologically relevant models.
For example, perhaps it is reasonable to pool only among adjacent ports (perhaps not), similarly it may be reasonable to assert that biologically similar regions can only possibly extent across a relatively small number of ports (if so, how many?).

Each of these hypotheses are easily represented as subsets of the total model space, $B_K$, as seen in Figure (1).
An exhaustive search of the models in these subspaces, and a comparison of the relative predictive accuracy of each model, provides concrete quantitative support for, or against, each of these hypotheses.
Thru this technique of exhaustive search and measuring relative predictive accuracy, we are able to understand the system to a greater degree than before possible. 
Furthermore such an exhaustive search of these model spaces allows for even more accurate estimates of species composition, and uncertainty, through the use of Bayesian model averaging among the candidate models.
Bayesian model averaging allows us to account for model uncertainty around these difficult modeling decisions, while combining the respective predictive capabilities of each model of a given subset of model space.

Once all of the models of a given model space are computed, combining them to account for model uncertainty thru Bayesian model averaging is straight forward.
For the $\mu^{th}$ model, of model space $\mathbb{M}$, a straight forward implementation of Bayes theorem gives,
$$Pr(\mathbb{M}_\mu|y) = \frac{ p(y|\mathbb{M}_\mu)p(\mathbb{M}_\mu) }{ \sum_\mu p(y|\mathbb{M}_\mu)p(\mathbb{M}_\mu) } = \omega_\mu$$
Where $\omega_\mu$ is the posterior probability that model $\mu$ is the true data generating model of the data, conditional on the subspace of candidate models and the observed data.
$\omega_\mu$ is then straightforwardly used to average together the posteriors of all of the candidate models, as follows
$$\bar p(\theta|y) = \sum_{\mu} \omega_\mu p(\theta|y, \mathbb{M}_\mu).$$

## Scalability

The above described system is already built and running on 2x12 core processors.
As a relatively small scale test we have considered the directly adjacent pooling possibilities among 5 port complexes at a time, along the coast of California (10 total port complexes), for all market categories.
Thus we were able to compute $26~categories \times \frac{16 models}{category} = 416~models$ in approximately a month of wall clock time running with 24 fold parallelism.
Since this work is almost entirely trivially parallelizable we have observed near linear speedup as we have made the code mode parallel within our current capabilities.

Given our current computational resources it is not practically feasible to attempt explorations that involve many more models than we have already accomplished.
However with access to more parallel infrastructure we foresee the ability to scale our current code with little modification.
The relevant variables determining run time are the size of the data, the number of parameters per model, and total number of models to consider.
Since the data and the maximum number of parameters per model are constants for a given $K$, and for large $K$, work is overwhelmingly dominated by the number of possible candidate models (models are trivially parallelizable), we believe that scaling will not be difficult as the number of available processors increases.

$$\bar p(\theta|y) = \sum_{j=1}^{\mathcal{M}} \omega_j p(\theta|y, \mathbb{M}_j)$$
if $f$ only depends on $\mathbb{M}$ thru $\theta$, then
$$\bar p(y^*|y) = \int f(y^*|\theta) \bar p(\theta|y) d\theta$$

# Abstract

In order to effectively manage exploited populations, accurate estimates of commercial fisheries catches are necessary to inform monitoring and assessment efforts.
In California, the high degree of heterogeneity in the species composition of many groundfish fisheries, particularly those targeting rockfish (Sebastes), leads to challenges in sampling all market categories, or species, adequately. 
Limited resources and increasingly complex stratification of the sampling system inevitably leads to gaps in sample data. 
In the presence of sampling gaps, ad-hoc species composition point estimation is currently obtained according to historically derived “data borrowing” protocols which do not allow for uncertainty estimation or forecasting. 
In order to move from the current ad-hoc "data-borrowing" design-based point estimators, we have constructed Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate species compositions, complete with accurate measures of uncertainty, as well as theoretically sound out-of-sample predictions.
Furthermore, we introduce a computational method for discovering consistent “borrowing” strategies across overstratified data.
Our modeling approach, along with a computationally robust system of inference and model exploration, allows us to start to understand the affect of the complexly stratified, and sparse, sampling system, on the kinds of inference possible, while simultaneously making the most from the available data.
