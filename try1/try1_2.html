# Abstract

Effective management of exploited fish populations, requires accurate estimates 
of commercial fisheries catches to inform monitoring and assessment efforts. 
In California, the high degree of heterogeneity in the species composition of 
many groundfish fisheries, particularly those targeting rockfish 
(genus $Sebastes$), leads to challenges in sampling all potential strata, or 
species, adequately. Limited resources and increasingly complex stratification 
of the sampling system inevitably leads to gaps in sample data. 
In the presence of sampling gaps, ad-hoc species composition point estimation 
is currently obtained according to historically derived data borrowing
(imputation) protocols which do not allow for uncertainty estimation or 
forecasting. In order to move from the current ad-hoc data-borrowing
point estimators, we have constructed Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate 
species compositions, complete with accurate measures of uncertainty, as well 
as theoretically sound out-of-sample predictions. Furthermore, we introduce a 
computational method for discovering consistent borrowing strategies 
across over-stratified data. Our modeling approach, along with a 
computationally robust system of inference and model exploration, allows us to 
start to understand the effect of the highly stratified, and sparse, sampling 
system on the kinds of inference possible, while simultaneously making the 
most from the available data.

# Significance

In order to understand how fish populations respond to fishing, it is critical 
to obtain accurate estimates of how many fish are removed from the ocean 
(catch) and to quantify the precision of those estimates. Traditionally, 
population dynamics models used to measure this response to fishing (stock 
assessments) are conditioned on a time series of annual catches. These catch 
estimates are often treated as being known without error, despite the fact 
that they are derived from sampling programs that estimate the proportion of 
unsampled strata must be filled in through a process sometimes referred 
to on the U.S. West Coast as borrowing (i.e. data imputation). Historically, 
methods used to borrow information among strata have been different species 
found within multiple sampling strata.Sampling error introduces uncertainty 
into estimates of the catch, and ad-hoc in nature and driven by expert opinion 
of local managers (Sen et al. 1984, 1986) (Pearson and Erwin  1997). We seek 
to improve upon this practice through development of a model-based approach 
that provides estimates of catch and associated uncertainty, as well as an 
objective, defensible framework for model selection and data imputation. 
Although the theoretical basis for a model based estimation of species 
composition in mixed stock fisheries has been advanced (Shelton et al., 2012), 
it has not yet been implemented successfully using actual historical or 
contemporary data.

![Spase Data](./pictures/sampleComplex.png)

The difficulties associated with the existing ad-hoc approach are magnified by 
an increase in the number of sampling strata over time, specifically the 
number of market categories, into which fishermen and dealers sort their 
catch (Figure 1, Bottom). The increase in the number of market categories 
(sampling strata) has not been matched by increases in sampling effort, 
resulting in a decline in the average number of samples per stratum (Figure 1, 
Middle). In other words, data are becoming more sparse, increasing our 
uncertainty in estimates of catch. Since the data are also stratified over a 
number of ports, fishing gear types, years, and quarters, inference is not 
possible without some sort of stratum pooling. Rather than rely so heavily on 
the previous, ad-hoc pooling rules which change based on the availability of 
samples, we hope to standardize any necessary pooling through an exhaustive 
search of the space (possible configurations) of pooled models. Pooling (and 
partial pooling) among strata is achieved using Bayesian hierarchical 
statistical models and model averaging (Gelman et al., 2014).

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Estimates of landed catch are a key component of many fishery management systems. Stock assessment models (referred to here as assessments) are often conditioned on time series of annual catch, usually under the assumption that catches are known without error. While some assessment models are able to incorporate uncertainty in catch (e.g. Stock Synthesis; Methot and Wetzel, 2013), reliable estimates of catch uncertainty are often unavailable. Without this information, assessment authors often rely on ad-hoc sensitivity analyses which may or may not be incorporated into management advice and/or fail to propagate catch uncertainty into quantities of interest to managers.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the estimation of catch and associated uncertainty has become a focus for recreational fisheries in the United States (NAS, 2017). Commercial fisheries, on the other hand, are often assumed to have precise estimates of catch by species. This is due in part to the availability of landing receipts (aka fish tickets) which serve as a record of the weight of fish landed into various market categories (sort groups). As noted by Pearson et al. (2008), it is important to recognize that species and market categories are not synonymous. On the U.S. West Coast, for example, it is common for multiple species to be landed within a single market category (CALCOM 2017, PacFIN 2017). This is expected for categories that are clearly designated as mixed-species categories (e.g. ``nearshore rockfish'', or species within a particular genus or family). However, in some states, categories that are named after a single species still contain several species, to varying degrees, even after regulations require sorting into a particular category (Pearson et al., 2008). As a result, estimation of landings for a single species based on landing receipt data alone may produce biased estimates of total catch.</p>
<p>Fisherman, dealers, or processors typically decide how to sort species into market categories on a landing receipt. Trained port samplers intercept vessels offloading catch or during subsequent processing in order to determine the species composition of catch landed in a given market category (Sen 1984, Crone 1995, Tsou et al. 2015). These species composition data are used to partition, or distribute, the weight of landed catch in a market category across species, a process commonly referred to as catch expansion (Pearson and Almany, 1995). To estimate total landings for a single species, the expanded catch is summed across all relevant market categories. Assuming that landing receipt data are a census of the landed catch, uncertainty in total catch for a given species reflects variability in the species composition among port samples. If information is available to estimate sources of bias in the landing receipt data, e.g. underreporting, then it is possible to also incorporate uncertainty in the bias correction factors as well (Bousquet et al. 2010). In this study, we quantify sampling uncertainty for estimates of landed catch, although the modeling framework could be extended to include uncertainty or bias in landing receipt data.</p>
<p>Within market categories, the species composition of landed catch can vary spatially, temporally, by fishing gear, and catch disposition (e.g. fish sold alive or dead). These differences are attributable to many factors, including market preference, fishing behavior, regulatory constraints, and biological/ecological characteristics (e.g. spatial distribution) of the landed species. As a result, estimates of species composition for a given market category are often stratified over time (e.g. quarterly) and across other relevant strata (e.g. ports, gears, catch disposition). Sampling programs often have limited funds, and attempts to reduce bias in species composition estimates through the introduction of additional strata comes at a cost, namely reduced precision (Cochran, 1977; Tomlinson, 1971).</p>
<p>On the U.S. West Coast, port sampling programs allocate effort both spatially and temporally, but many domains of interest (e.g. market category, gear type, catch disposition) remain unsampled or sparsely sampled due to a proliferation of categories over time, logistical constraints, and limited resources (Sen 1986; Crone 1995; Pearson et al. 2008; Tsou et al. 2015). In California, for example, commercial port sampling effort has changed over time and space (Pearson and Almany 1995). For example, regular sampling of California ports north of Point Conception (roughly <span class="math inline">34<sup>∘</sup></span> 27' N. latitude) began as early as 1978, but the more southern ports were rarely sampled prior to 1983. This allocation of effort was largely based on the statewide distribution of landings, diffuse spatial distribution of southern commercial ports, and limitations in funding for port samplers.</p>
<p>When no port samples are collected for landed strata and domains, species composition estimates are ‘borrowed’ from other strata using deterministic algorithms based on expert opinion. These algorithms have unknown bias and precision. In contrast, model-based estimators are increasingly used to estimate quantities of interest for domains with small sample sizes and/or unsampled strata (sometimes referred to as small area estimation; Rao 2003).<br />
Shelton et al. (2012) developed a Bayesian hierarchical statistical framework for species composition data that pools information among sparsely sampled strata, predicts species compositions for unsampled strata, and can be combined with landing receipts to estimate total landings by species, across market categories and other strata, with associated estimates of uncertainty. Shelton et al. considered hierarchical pooling only among quarters within a single year, comparing generalized linear and hierarchical linear models to trawl data from a single port in California. The authors underscored the need to better understand performance of alternative models, and to overcome issues with computation time, particularly since commercial port sampling data sets often include hundreds of landed strata spanning decades, multiple ports, gear types, and other domains of interest.</p>
<p>Among the U.S. West Coast states, the challenge of estimating landings for sparsely-sampled mixed stock fisheries is perhaps greatest for California. Relative to Oregon and Washington, California has a greater number of commercial ports, market categories, and landed species, with greater species diversity among ports due to the geographical range of the coast. Of particular consequence to the estimation of species compositions is the proliferation of landed market categories over time, particularly during the 1990s (Figure 1). Sampling effort also leveled off in the mid-1990s, with a reduction in effort in the early 2000s. The net result of increased stratification and flat (or reduced) sampling effort over time is a decline in mean sample size per stratum (Figure 1). In this situation, it is critical to understand how efforts to reduce bias (e.g. increasing the number of landed market categories) affect precision of the expanded catch estimates.</p>
<p>Models that take catch uncertainty into account are not new (c.f. Doubleday 1976), but most assessments on the U.S. West Coast assume catch is known without error (PFMC 2018). As a result, catch uncertainty is not propagated into management reference points. However, the implications of catch uncertainty are not limited to stock assessment efforts. In a management context, catch estimates with large (but unknown) uncertainty may cause managers to react to large, high-frequency deviations in estimated catch, and either impose unnecessary restrictions on a fishery, or mistakenly support excessive harvest. This is particularly an issue for prohibited and/or ‘choke’ species, for which information is limited and may be based solely on estimates of discarded catch.</p>
<p>In this study, we evaluate the model-based framework proposed by Shelton et al. (2012) using commercial port sampling data collected in California, U.S.A. We describe species composition data collected by the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS, 2017) over the period 1978-1990. We then extend the Shelton et al. framework to address limitations of their approach. Specifically, we evaluate alternative likelihoods to address overdispersion, compare multiple hierarchical structures for pooling information through time, and integrate model predictions across uncertainties in the spatial model structure. Finally, we estimate landed catch by species for both sampled and unsampled strata, and summarize a general framework for quantifying uncertainty including an efficient database design for dissemination of results at any level of aggregation.</p>

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>As outlined in <span class="math inline">(<em>c</em><em>i</em><em>t</em><em>e</em>)</span> the data in <span class="math inline"><em>b</em><em>l</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>k</em></span> are the result of a cluster sampling protocol across the many strata, in which each sample is intended to be composed of two fifty pound clusters from the selected stratum. Although port samplers do their best to follow protocol, in reality the port sampling environment does not always allow the exact <span class="math inline">(<em>c</em><em>i</em><em>t</em><em>e</em>)</span> protocol to be followed. Variations in the sampling protocol may result in only a single cluster being taken, or the size of clusters taken to vary, from stratum to stratum based on the particular challenges of sampling each stratum.</p>
<p>[add more detailed description of data here; e.g. samples are recorded as integer weights (pounds) by port samplers, number of market categories, range of years, gears, port complexes, ignoring live fish for now, etc.; show map of state with port complexes.]</p>
<p>The model based methodology proposed here does not rely strongly upon the cluster sampling structure, but rather simply views each sample as independent and identically distributed (<span class="math inline"><em>i</em>.<em>i</em>.<em>d</em>.</span>) draws from a data generating model, conditional on a parameterization of the stratification system. So long as the parameterization and data generating model are sufficiently robust for handling the behavior of these data, a conditionally <span class="math inline"><em>i</em>.<em>i</em>.<em>d</em>.</span> model of these data will be practically useful for producing predictions about the data generating system. <!-- even if our model does not replicate the true data generating process exactly.--></p>
<p>That said, for the purpose of modeling these data, it is enough to know which clusters were collected as part of which samples, and how big each cluster actually ended up being. This information is readily available from CALCOM, a database maintained by the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CALCOM 2018). Specifically, we aggregate all observed clusters across <!--or the purpose of the models presented here, all of the--> a unique sample so that the total weight sampled is the sum of all pounds in each unique sample. Similarly the observed weight for a particular species in each unique sample is the sum of all of the observed weights, for that species, across each cluster of each unique sample.</p>
<p>Although model based data analysis has the potential to add significant structure to data, a judicious application of these methods must always confront the model with enough empirical information to adequately learn about the system. In this setting some market categories and time periods may not be well enough sampled to learn the parameters of the models presented here. For this reason, we refrain from modeling any period where the minimum number of possible parameters exceeds the number of samples for the modeled period. Rather than apply models inappropriately, these landings are speciated as the nominal species for their market category. We later demonstrate that due to the prioritization for sampling heavily landed, or otherwise commercially relevant categories, this sample size heuristic only leads to nominal speciation in market categories and time periods where total landings are low. Thus nominal landings represent a negligible component of the overall expansion process.</p>

Since model based strategies of data analysis are reliant not only on a

to only apply the models in cases where it is reasonable to expect  models to

<!--Something something hierarchical Poisson model. Something something (Shelton, 2012).-->
<p>For the purposes of accurately modeling not only species composition means, but also higher moments of the data, such as species composition variances, it is necessary to recognize model limitations with respect to over-dispersed data. Among the simplest models for count data are the Poisson and binomial models. Both models are typically specified with a single parameter for <!--degree of freedom for--> modeling all of the moments of the data, and thus they rely heavily on their respective data generating processes to accurately represent higher moments in the data. McCullagh and Nelder (1989, pg. 124) commiserate about the prevalence of over-dispersed data in cluster sampling, and explain ways in which cluster sampling itself may result in over-dispersion.</p>
<p>Extending the Poisson and binomial models to deal with over-dispersion, typically involves adding additional parameters for the purpose of modeling higher moments of the data. The negative binomial (NB) distribution is often used as an over-dispersed extension of the Poisson model, since it can be expressly written as an infinite mixture of Poisson distributions. While the beta-binomial model is typically used to as an over-dispersed extension of the binomial model.</p>

<p>To discern between these discrete modeling options we consider a small scale example of the Poisson, binomial, negative binomial, and beta-binomial models fit to the port sampling integer weight data from market category 250, in the Monterey port complex trawl fishery in 1982. <span class="math inline">(<em>a</em><em>n</em><em>y</em><em>w</em><em>i</em><em>l</em><em>l</em><em>w</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>k</em>)</span> This stratum was visited 32 times by port samplers, collecting a total of 59 <!--38 times by port samplers, collecting a total of 67--> cluster samples across 55 unique species. <!--344 model observations across 21 $(at least; URCK)$ unique species.--> Each of the above models are fit to these data.</p>
<p>The Poisson and binomial models attempt to model both the mean and residual variance of the data with a single parameter for each species. By definition these models have residual variances which are tied to the species means. Simply estimating the mean parameters in these cases may not be sufficient to produce models which predict well.</p>
<p>In contrast, the negative binomial and beta-binomial models estimate an additional parameter which can be used to disentangle the mean and residual variance estimates. Thus the negative binomial and beta-binomial models may produce more accurate estimates of the residual variance. Furthermore, in better modeling the variance, these models may often produce more accurate measures of center as well. <!--Thus it is possible that the negative binomial and--></p>
<p>For each of the above mentioned models the predictive species composition distributions are visualized in Figure(<span class="math inline"><em>I</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>v</em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>P</em><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>t</em></span>) as 95% Highest Density Intervals (HDI) <span class="math inline">(<em>c</em><em>i</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>s</em>)</span>, plotted on top of the predictive means for each model and the observed species compositions from the data in Figure(<span class="math inline"><em>I</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>v</em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>P</em><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>t</em></span>). For brevity we only consider the most prevalent six species in this example (CLPR, BCAC, WDOW, BLGL, ARRA, BANK). Additionally, the MSE, DIC, WAIC, and Bayesian marginal likelihood model probabilities are computed for each model as measures of model fit as seen in Table(<span class="math inline"><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>k</em><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>h</em><em>o</em><em>o</em><em>d</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>b</em><em>l</em><em>e</em></span>).</p>

<p>Since the <span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub>0</sub></span> reference level is chosen arbitrarily, with no conception of which values it may take, no restrictions are placed on the value of the intercept. The species (<span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>j</em></sub><sup>(<em>s</em>)</sup></span>), port-complex (<span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>k</em></sub><sup>(<em>p</em>)</sup></span>), and gear-group (<span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>l</em></sub><sup>(<em>g</em>)</sup></span>) offsets are assigned diffuse normal priors. The large fixed values of the prior variance hyperparameters produce behavior similar to classical fixed effect models for species, port-complex, and gear- group parameters.</p>
<p>In returning to the time parameter model, <span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>m</em><em>η</em></sub><sup>(<em>t</em>)</sup></span>, it is useful to consider how the inclusion of predictively superfluous parameters may cause overfitting and weaken model performance through the bias-variance dilemma (Ramasubramanian, K., &amp; Singh, A., 2016). Simply put, the bias-variance dilemma means that model formulation is not simply a bias reduction task, but rather the goal is to formulate models which reduce bias, while jointly minimizing uncertainty. Janyes (2003, pg. 511) describes how the inclusion of estimation bias via the Bayesian methodology may produce better performing estimates, more quickly, than unbiased counterparts. Among the simplest ways to see the principle is in the structure of the MSE performance metric, and how it can be explicitly written to value both estimator bias and variance, as follows.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\text{MSE}(\hat\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[~(\hat\theta - \theta)^2~\right] = \overbrace{\mathbb{E}\Big[~\left(\hat\theta-\mathbb{E}(\hat\theta)\right)^2~\Big]}^{\text{Var}(\hat \theta)} + \overbrace{\Big(~\mathbb{E}(\hat\theta)-\theta~\Big)^2}^{\text{Bias}(\hat \theta, \theta)^2}$$</span><br /></p>
<!--
Including additional model parameters is a great way to decrease model bias, 
however it is apparent from the structure of the MSE that decreasing model 
bias alone is not a good way of arriving at a well performing model. Models 
with good MSEs jointly minimize the bias of their parameter estimates, in 
addition to estimation uncertainty of their parameters. 
-->
<p>Furthermore a model can minimize bias, without regard for estimation uncertainty, by including one model parameter to be fit to each observation. These parameter estimates are totally unbiased, however such a model is also predictively useless since each estimated parameter is specifically bound to a<br />
particular observation, and thus such a model does not generalize. <!--has no information for which to base predictions on future data.--></p>

This interaction term allows estimates for particular quarters to differ from year to year, as opposed to the previous models in which quarters within a year are assumed to be identical from year to year.</p>
<p>Furthermore the <span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>m</em><em>η</em></sub><sup>(<em>y</em> : <em>q</em>)</sup></span> are also modeled hierarchically to introduce a single variance parameter, <span class="math inline"><em>v</em></span>, shared among all of the <span class="math inline"><em>m</em><em>η</em></span> time chunks.

This leaves all temporal information in the data to be modeled solely by the quarterly <span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>m</em><em>η</em></sub><sup>(<em>y</em> : <em>q</em>)</sup></span> interaction terms. This model represents more opportunity for partial pooling through time than (M3), as fewer time parameters are introduced.

<p>(M6) follows the same idea as (M5), however here interaction terms are allowed to partially pool interactions within a common year, across the quarters of that year, but not between years. (M6) often involves fitting slightly more parameters than (M5) because, at least in this setting, it is typical to model more than four years of data at once.</p>
<p>Hierarchical variance parameters are estimated from the data. As the above models learn the posteriors of the hierarchical variance parameters, it affects the degree of shrinkage as well as the effective number of parameters held within the respective hierarchies (Gelman, 2014). To achieve this, each variance parameter must itself be assigned a prior to be estimated. For all of the hierarchical variance parameters included in the above models <span class="math inline"><em>v</em></span> is assigned a diffuse <span class="math inline"><em>v</em> ∼ <em>I</em><em>G</em>(1,  2 × 10<sup>3</sup>)</span> prior. <!--and heavy tailed--></p>
<!--first logit transformed to have values spanning the entire real number line and assigned the prior-->

The <span class="math inline"><em>N</em>(0, 2<sup>2</sup>)</span> prior is indeed a symmetric, and far reaching, prior when back transformed to the unit interval. To notice this, it is helpful to realize that the central 95% interval for a <span class="math inline"><em>N</em>(0, 2<sup>2</sup>)</span> (i.e. <span class="math inline">0 ± 3.91</span>), includes almost the entirety of the back transformed unit interval (i.e. <span class="math inline">0.5 ± 0.48</span>).</p>
<p>Table(<span class="math inline"><em>p</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>b</em><em>l</em><em>e</em></span>) shows a clear preference for model (M4). It is worth mentioning that among all of the models considered here, (M4) offers the largest potential for hierarchical partial pooling among the time parameters.

<p>Estimating model (M4) in a Bayesian way gives access to the full posterior distribution of all of the parameters of the model. It is useful to emphasize that in the Bayesian setting, these parameters have full distributions, and they are typically handled as a large number of samples from the joint posterior distribution of the parameters. Once the posterior sampling is complete, this simplifies parameter mean and variance estimation; required moments are simply obtained by computing the desired moments from the posterior samples. Additionally, the fact that the parameters are full distributions means that any functions which contain, or are derived from, parameters are themselves random variables with the function representing a random variable transformation of those parameters.</p>

<p>Presently, stratum with diminishingly small sample sizes are managed by an ad-hoc &quot;data borrowing&quot; protocol, as outlined in Pearson and Erwin (1997). The protocol for &quot;data borrowing&quot; calls for pooling only when forced to fill holes brought about by unsampled strata. Naturally, such a pooling protocol introduces bias to fill in unsampled strata, however due to the mathematically unstructured way in which this bias is introduced, it is hard to quantitatively justify these &quot;data borrowing&quot; rules.</p>
<p>Model (M4) avoids temporal ad-hoc &quot;borrowing&quot; protocols used in Pearson and Erwin (1997) by making use of its hierarchical structure to fill temporal holes with a posterior predictive distribution for unseen time periods within the modeled period. This hierarchical structure uses the data to estimate the degree of pooling through time, rather than ad-hoc &quot;data borrowing&quot;.</p>
<!--
Furthermore the Bayesian predictive framework, allows holes 
in the data to be filled with posterior predictive distributions for any 
unobserved strata.

<!-- %efforts to pool data through time via the hierarchical priors described in section (XX) -->
<p>Despite the benefits of modeling these data as Bayesian hierarchical models, port sampling data still remains sparse. Given the degree of sparsity in these data it is certainly possible that models which consider an additional degree of data pooling between port complexes may offer predictive benefits. In exploring strategies for pooling data across space it is necessary to formalize the port complex pooling scheme in a way which provides a mathematically understandable and scalable structure to build upon.</p>
<p>Given the categorical nature of port complex variables, the typical hierarchical regularization priors among port complexes are not appropriate. Rather, we frame port complex pooling as a model uncertainty problem, in which we consider some degree of port complex pooling, but the exact degree of pooling, and the particular partitioning of the pooled port complexes are not known.</p>
<p>Port complex pooling is achieved by repeatedly fitting model (M4) with different partitionings of the port complex variables within a particular market category and modeling time period. This model exploration exercise explores the possible ways to produce groupings of the existing port complexes so as to discover predictively useful partitionings of the port complexes. Insisting that the port complex groupings be partitions of the available port complexes provides a well defined mathematical structure for exploring the space of pooled port complexes.</p>
<p>The size of the space of possible pooled models is in the setting is well defined in terms of the size of the set of items to be partitioned, <span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span>, as given by the Bell numbers (<span class="math inline"><em>B</em><sub><em>K</em></sub></span>),</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$B_K=\sum_{\hat k=0}^{K} \frac{1}{\hat k!} \left( \sum_{j=0}^{\hat k} (-1)^{\hat k -j} \left(\substack{\hat k \\ j}\right) j^K \right).$$</span><br /></p>
<p>In the case of California the set of items to be partitioned is the set of port complexes in California, of which there are <span class="math inline"><em>K</em> = 10</span>, implying a grand total of <span class="math inline"><em>B</em><sub>10</sub> = 115975</span> ways of partitioning the port complexes in California in each market category and modeled time period. The brute force model selection strategy of computing all 115975 of these partitionings strategies is computationally infeasible. However, not all pooling schemes represent biologically relevant models. For example, perhaps it is reasonable to pool only among adjacent ports (i.e. no discontinuities between port complex pooling in space), or perhaps it is reasonable to assert that biologically similar regions can only extend across a small number of ports.</p>
<p>Here only adjacent port poolings are considered, such that the maximum size of a port complex grouping is three port complexes. These are the only two constraints that are enforced on port complex partitions here, although many other constraints may, in theory, be chosen. These constraints were chosen so as to mirror the currently accepted protocols in Pearson and Erwin (1997) within the context of this framework. When these two simple constraints are applied, the number of models to explore in each modeled period is reduced to a much more manageable 274 models.</p>
<p>An exhaustive search of the models in the biologically constrained subspace of <span class="math inline"><em>B</em><sub>10</sub></span>, allows for a concrete comparison of the relative predictive accuracy of each partitioning. Additionally the partitioned models provide a set of candidate models for use in Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) (Hoeting et al., 1999). BMA, as applied here, essentially allows the model exploration strategy to average across all relevant port complex partitionings and adds robustness to the final species composition estimates.</p>
<p>For the <span class="math inline"><em>ι</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> model in a set of candidate models <span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span>, then the BMA weight for <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub><em>ι</em></sub></span> follows directly from Bayes Theorem as,</p>

<p>Figure <span class="math inline">(<em>b</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>s</em>)</span> shows the relative sampling effort and landings across rockfish market cateogries accounting for the top 99% percent of landings for two modeled periods. In the top panel of each modeled period the black line represented the proportion of landings in each market category, while the blue line represents the proportion of samples, by number, taken in each market category. In the bottom panel of each modeled period, colors represent the proportion of sampled weight of twelve commercially realavant species. Alternating dark and light grey panels fill in all other species. On the top of each bar the number of observed species in each market category is listed. Hatched regions indicated the nominal species of a market category where applicable.</p>
<p>Notice that sampling effort both tracks landings as well as the number of species in each market category. These two factors are among the most important factors to prioritize in sampling for the sake of applying our model's results to a large proportion of landings <span class="math inline">(<em>W</em><em>h</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em>p</em><em>r</em><em>o</em><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em>l</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>d</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>m</em><em>o</em><em>d</em><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>e</em><em>x</em><em>p</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>d</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em>?)</span>.<br />
Furthermore due to this pattern in port sampling, when sample sizes become too small to apply our model, <!--, in a modeled period,--> the expanded landings tend to represent a negligible proportion of total landings.</p>
<p>The lower panels of Figure <span class="math inline">(<em>b</em><em>a</em><em>r</em>)</span> visually demonstrates just how many different species are landed into commercially relevant market categories. Although market categories often carry names that label them with a nominal species, Figure <span class="math inline">(<em>b</em><em>a</em><em>r</em>)</span> makes it abundantly clear that these names can mislead our thinking about the purity, and consistency, of these categories through time. To drive this point home, consider market category 267. The nominal label for market category 267 is Brown, while Brown rockfish only amounts to 6.3% of the sampled weight in 1978-1982. In 1978-1982 market category 267 might be better named Widow as Widow rockfish amounts to 92.6% of sampled weight in this time period, however considering the most recent time period (2000-2015), in Appendix Figure <span class="math inline">(<em>p</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>e</em><em>l</em>)</span>, market category 267 samples are composed of 99.6% Brown and 0% Widow.</p>

<p>The large spread of the observed species compositions seen in Figure(likelihoods) visually demonstrate the degree of overdispersion present in port sampling data. The Poisson and binomial models disregard this overdispersion to prioritize fitting the data mean.

<p>The split beta-binomial intervals seen in Figure(likelihoods) are the consequence of confining a large amount of residual variability to the unit interval. The beta-binomial is the only model considered here, which estimates such a large degree of variability and thus it is the only model that produces predictive species composition distributions of the sort. Figure(violin) shows the beta-binomial predictive distributions as a violin plot demonstrating how the beta-binomial model arranges predictive density over the unit interval. The predictive intervals in Figure(likelihoods) are the smallest possible regions on each of these densities so that each intervals contain 95% probability. Species composition is bounded on [0, 1], thus in the presence of large variability predictive density may aggregate around the bounds. For the example of STRK, notice that although the predictive HDI is split, the vast majority of density lies directly atop the data.</p>

The following ten rows indicate the ten port complexes in California, and the colored cells indicate how port complexes are partitioned in each model.</p>
<p>Considering Figure<span class="math inline">(<em>m</em><em>o</em><em>d</em><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>e</em><em>c</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em>)</span>, the best partitioned model gives distinct parameters to CRS and ERK, while pooling BRG/BDG, OSF/MNT/MRO, and OSB/OLA/OSD. This model uses five parameters to model the ten ports complexes in California. Given the set of candidate models explained above, the BMA procedure weights this model at approximately 32% of the truth. Notice that the only difference among the top four models is in how the port complexes south of point conception are handled. In fact, when the seven northernly port complexes are fixed in the described partitioning, the top four models represent all of the possible partitionings of the southern three port complexes.</p>
<p>In this modeled period it is known that no species composition sampling (landings?) was done south of point conception, thus it is not surprising that these models perform similarly. When no data is present, parameters simply represent place holders for out of sample prediction. Since the port complexes south of point conception are not informed by data, the predictions are identical in these categories. Since the first model makes identical predictions to the following three, and does so using the fewest parameters, it is correctly identified as the most parsimonious explanation among these data.</p>
<p>When considering how the top four model partitionings share identical structure in the seven northernly port complexes, while exhaustively spanning the candidate partitions south of point conception, it is simple to see that BMA assign's approximately 71% marginal probability to the northernly model structure.</p>

It is helpful to notice that for a given modeled period all market categories are 
modeled over the same number of years and quarters; furthermore all port complexes 
and gear groups are present in each market category. Thus considering 
Eq($linear predictor$) the primary difference in the number of parameters between 
market categories comes from the number of species present. 

Assuming that it is desirable to better characterize market categories with larger 
landings. If the number of species in each market category were the same, one would 
expect sampling effort to roughly track landings, so as to achieve more samples per 
parameter in more heavily landed market categories. In Figure $(bars)$ we roughly 
observe this pattern. However it is clear that deviations from this pattern appear 
when many more or less species are present in a market category. These deviations 
take samples away from market categories with relatively few parameters and add 
samples to market categories with relatively greater numbers of parameters so as to 
keep the overall number of samples per parameter in track with landed weight.

The straight-forward spatial model implied by the categorical port complex 
variables do not adequately resolve in-sample prediction at the observed

Presently these diminishingly small within stratum sample sizes are managed 
by an ad-hoc "borrowing" protocol outlined by Pearson and Erwin (1997).

The space of possible pooled models is well defined in terms of the size of 
the set of items to be partitioned, $K$, as described by the Bell numbers 
($B_K$), 
$$B_K=\sum_{\hat k=0}^{K} \frac{1}{\hat k!} \left( \sum_{j=0}^{\hat k} (-1)^{\hat k -j} \left(\substack{\hat k \\ j}\right) j^K \right).$$
The most straight-forward solution in the presence of this type of model

However, maybe not all pooling schemes represent biologically relevant models.
For example, perhaps it is reasonable to pool only among adjacent ports, or to

Each of these hypotheses are easily represented as subsets of the total model 
space, $B_K$, as seen in Figure (2). An exhaustive search of the models in 
these subspaces, and a comparison of the relative predictive accuracy of each 
model, provides concrete quantitative support for, or against, each of these 
hypotheses. Through this technique of exhaustive search and measuring relative 
predictive accuracy, we are able to understand the system to a greater degree

Bayesian model averaging allows us to account for model uncertainty around

Once all of the models of a given model space are computed, combining them to 
account for model uncertainty, through BMA, requires trivial computation time, 
but adds substantial robustness to our predictions.

Given observed overdispersion relative to the Poisson and Binomial 
distributions, the Beta-Binomial model makes use of a correlation parameter, 
$\rho$, to better model uncertainties, while maintaining a flexible model on 
stratum means through the linear predictor. The linear predictor parameters, 
$\theta$, are then factored as follows among the many strata,

$$\theta_{jklm\eta} = \beta_0 + \beta^{(s)}_j + \beta^{(p)}_k + \beta^{(g)}_l + \beta^{(y:q)}_{m\eta}.$$

As a Bayesian model, we specify any information external to the dataset, 
through our priors on the parameters, $p(\theta)$.Our priors are largely 
diffuse normals, representing relatively little prior information, producing 
behavior similar to classical fixed effect models on species 
($\beta^{(s)}_j$), port ($\beta^{(p)}_k$), and gear ($\beta^{(g)}_l$) 
parameters.Our priors on time parameters ($\beta^{(y:q)}_{m\eta}$) are modeled 
similarly to a classical random effects model, which uses the data to estimate 
a shared variance among all year-quarter interaction terms.Such a hierarchical 
prior thru time, imposes the prior information that data thru time share some 
degree of similarity, however the exact degree of similarity is not specified, 
rather the degree of similarity among time parameters is itself a parameter to 
be estimated from the data.In recent years, inference on these models has 
become faster and easier to compute through the use of computational Laplace 
approximations (Rue et al., 2009); we compute inferences on the above model in 
R (R Core Team, 2015) using the R-INLA package (Rue et al., 2013). 

## Species Composition

Applying the Bayesian predictive framework to the above model gives the 
following expressions for predicted weight in each stratum,
$$p(y^*_{jklm\eta}|y) = \int\!\!\!\!\int\! \text{BB}\Big( y^*_{jklm\eta}|\theta_{jklm\eta}, \rho \Big) P\Big(\theta_{jklm\eta}, \rho | y\Big) d\theta_{jklm\eta} d\rho.$$
$p(y^*_{jklm\eta}|y)$ is computed via Monte Carlo integration and represents 
the model's full predictive distribution for the $j^{th}$ species' weight, in 
the $k^{th}$ port, caught with the $l^{th}$ gear, in the $\eta^{th}$ quarter, 
of year $m$.
Considering the same type of prediction across all species in a particular 
stratum allows for the calculation of predictive species compositions.
The following joint transformation of the species' predictive weights result 
in predictive species compositions, 
$$\pi^*_{jklm\eta} = \frac{y^*_{jklm\eta}}{\sum_j y^*_{jklm\eta}} ~~~ y^*_{klm\eta}\neq 0.$$
Because the $y^*$ are random variables, and $\pi^*$ is nothing more than a 
transformation of the $y^*$, $\pi^*$ is too a random variable. 
Furthermore once inference is complete, we can easily sample these 
distributions and compute any desired moments from these samples.

The straight-forward spatial model implied by the categorical port complex 
variables do not adequatly resolve in-sample prediction at the observed 
sample sizes. 
Presently these diminishingly small within stratum sample sizes are managed 
by an ad-hoc "borrowing" protocol outlined by Pearson and Erwin (1997).
We aim to formalize this "borrowing" idea via an exhaustive search of spatially 
pooled models, combined with the formalized process of Bayesian Model 
Averaging (BMA) to appropriatly integrate port-complex pooling model 
uncertainty into species composition estimates (Hoeting et al. , 1999).


The space of possible pooled models is well defined in terms of the size of 
the set of items to be partitioned, $K$, as described by the Bell numbers 
($B_K$), 
$$B_K=\sum_{\hat k=0}^{K} \frac{1}{\hat k!} \left( \sum_{j=0}^{\hat k} (-1)^{\hat k -j} \left(\substack{\hat k \\ j}\right) j^K \right).$$
The most straight-forward solution in the presence of this type of model 
uncertainty is to compute all $B_K$ possible pooling schemes.
However, maybe not all pooling schemes represent biologically relevant models.
For example, perhaps it is reasonable to pool only among adjacent ports, or to 
assert that biologically similar regions can only extend across a small number
of ports (if so, how many?).

Each of these hypotheses are easily represented as subsets of the total model 
space, $B_K$, as seen in Figure (2). An exhaustive search of the models in 
these subspaces, and a comparison of the relative predictive accuracy of each 
model, provides concrete quantitative support for, or against, each of these 
hypotheses. Through this technique of exhaustive search and measuring relative 
predictive accuracy, we are able to understand the system to a greater degree 
than before possible. Furthermore such an exhaustive search of these model 
spaces allows for even more accurate estimates of species composition, and 
uncertainty, through the use of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) among the 
candidate models.
Bayesian model averaging allows us to account for model uncertainty around 
these difficult modeling decisions, while combining the respective predictive 
capabilities of each model of a given subset of model space 
(Hoeting et al., 1999). 
Once all of the models of a given model space are computed, combining them to 
account for model uncertainty, through BMA, requires trivial computation time, 
but adds substantial robustness to our predictions.

BMA

Bayesian model averaging is straight forward. For the $\mu^{th}$ model, of 
model space $\mathbb{M}$, a straight forward implementation of Bayes theorem 
gives, 
$$Pr(\mathbb{M}_\mu|y) = \frac{ p(y|\mathbb{M}_\mu)p(\mathbb{M}_\mu) }{ \sum_\mu p(y|\mathbb{M}_\mu)p(\mathbb{M}_\mu) } = \omega_\mu$$
Where $\omega_\mu$ is the posterior probability that model $\mu$ is the true 
data generating model of the data, conditional on the subspace of candidate 
models and the observed data. $\omega_\mu$ is then straightforwardly used to 
average together the posteriors of all of the candidate models, as follows
$\bar p(\theta|y) = \sum_{\mu} \omega_\mu p(\theta|y, \mathbb{M}_\mu).$

NOTE: Lots of stratum: market category, port, gear, year, qtr. Data becoming more and more sparse. reframe figures.

In the present sample-based methodology, data is required in each unique stratification of the system to obtain any estimate.
Given the complex, and numerous, stratification of this system, many stratum do not have observations, and thus inference is not possible without some sort of stratum pooling.
Pooling data will naturally increase the bias of the resulting estimates, but when no other data is available, a slightly biased estimate is better than no estimate at all.
In the current state of affairs, a "historically" derived set of pooling rules have been implemented across ports when no other data is available.
The "historical" pooling rules are largely based on personal experience with the sampling process, although quantifiable evidence for the implemented rules have been hard to produce until recently.

# Technical Project Plan

## Model

For a particular market category, $y_{ijklm\eta}$ is the  $i^{th}$ sample of the $j^{th}$ species’ weight, in the $k^{th}$ port, caught with the $l^{th}$ gear, in the $\eta^{th}$ quarter, of year $m$.
In accordance with the typical model based statistical procedure, the $y_{ijklm\eta}$ are said to be observations from a statistical distribution $f$ conditional on some parameters $\theta$ and $\rho$.
$$y_{ijklm\eta} \sim f(y_{ijklm\eta}|\theta, \rho).$$
Given observed overdispersion relative to the Poisson and Binomial distributions, we have found the Beta-Binomial distribution to perform well as an observation model for these data.
The linear predictor parameters, $\theta$, are then factored as follows among the many stratum, 
$$\theta_{jklm\eta} = \beta_0 + \beta^{(s)}_j + \beta^{(p)}_k + \beta^{(g)}_l + \beta^{(y:q)}_{m\eta}.$$
$\rho$ is a correlation parameter among the stratum, which gives the Beta-Binomial added flexibility for modeling overdisperse data.

As a Bayesian model, we specify any information external to the dataset, thru our priors on the parameters, $p(\theta)$.
Our priors are largely diffuse normals, representing relatively little prior information, producing behavior similar to classical fixed effect models on species ($\beta^{(s)}_j$), port ($\beta^{(p)}_k$), and gear ($\beta^{(g)}_l$) parameters.
Our priors on time parameters ($\beta^{(y:q)}_{m\eta}$) are modeled similarly to a classical random effects model, which uses the data to estimate a shared variance among all year-quarter interaction terms.
Such a hierarchical prior thru time, imposes the prior information that data thru time share some degree of similarity, however the exact degree of similarity is not specified, rather the degree of similarity among time parameters is itself a parameter to be estimated from the data.

In the past such models have been difficult to fit, due to relatively slow, unparallelizable, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods of inference.
In recent years, inference on these models has become faster thru the use of computational Laplace approximations (Rue et al., 2009), as distributed thru the R-INLA package (Rue et al., 2013).
Of primary note, the INLA method of inference is largely parallelizable, and does not rely on the subjective process of determining Markov chain convergence.
Together the parallelizable and "hands-off" nature of INLA inference allows for automated model exploration.

## Model Exploration
-->
<!--, or even beyond spatial parameters, into other stratum, or other difficult modeling decisions, as resources allow.-->
<!--
With the added ability to automate Bayesian model exploration, we desire to explore the space of pooled models with the hope of obtaining quantitative evidence of optimal pooling behavior in space.
Furthermore as resources allow, model exploration could easily extend across any other difficult modeling decisions which may represent significant sources of model uncertainty.
The space of possible pooled models is well defined in terms of the size of the set of items to be partitioned, $K$, as described by the Bell numbers ($B_K$),
$$B_K=\sum_{\hat k=0}^{K} \frac{1}{\hat k!} \left( \sum_{j=0}^{\hat k} (-1)^{\hat k -j} \left(\substack{\hat k \\ j}\right) j^K \right).$$
The most straight-forward solution in the presence of this type of model uncertainty is to simply compute all $B_K$ possible pooling schemes.
However, practically speaking, not all pooling schemes necessarily represent biologically relevant models.
For example, perhaps it is reasonable to pool only among adjacent ports (perhaps not), similarly it may be reasonable to assert that biologically similar regions can only possibly extent across a relatively small number of ports (if so, how many?).

Each of these hypotheses are easily represented as subsets of the total model space, $B_K$, as seen in Figure (1).
An exhaustive search of the models in these subspaces, and a comparison of the relative predictive accuracy of each model, provides concrete quantitative support for, or against, each of these hypotheses.
Thru this technique of exhaustive search and measuring relative predictive accuracy, we are able to understand the system to a greater degree than before possible. 
Furthermore such an exhaustive search of these model spaces allows for even more accurate estimates of species composition, and uncertainty, through the use of Bayesian model averaging among the candidate models.
Bayesian model averaging allows us to account for model uncertainty around these difficult modeling decisions, while combining the respective predictive capabilities of each model of a given subset of model space.

-->
<!--
Once all of the models of a given model space are computed, combining them to account for model uncertainty thru Bayesian model averaging is straight forward.
For the $\mu^{th}$ model, of model space $\mathbb{M}$, a straight forward implementation of Bayes theorem gives,
$$Pr(\mathbb{M}_\mu|y) = \frac{ p(y|\mathbb{M}_\mu)p(\mathbb{M}_\mu) }{ \sum_\mu p(y|\mathbb{M}_\mu)p(\mathbb{M}_\mu) } = \omega_\mu$$
Where $\omega_\mu$ is the posterior probability that model $\mu$ is the true data generating model of the data, conditional on the subspace of candidate models and the observed data.
$\omega_\mu$ is then straightforwardly used to average together the posteriors of all of the candidate models, as follows
$$\bar p(\theta|y) = \sum_{\mu} \omega_\mu p(\theta|y, \mathbb{M}_\mu).$$

## Scalability

The above described system is already built and running on 2x12 core processors.
As a relatively small scale test we have considered the directly adjacent pooling possibilities among 5 port complexes at a time, along the coast of California (10 total port complexes), for all market categories.
Thus we were able to compute $26~categories \times \frac{16 models}{category} = 416~models$ in approximately a month of wall clock time running with 24 fold parallelism.
Since this work is almost entirely trivially parallelizable we have observed near linear speedup as we have made the code mode parallel within our current capabilities.

Given our current computational resources it is not practically feasible to attempt explorations that involve many more models than we have already accomplished.
However with access to more parallel infrastructure we foresee the ability to scale our current code with little modification.
The relevant variables determining run time are the size of the data, the number of parameters per model, and total number of models to consider.
Since the data and the maximum number of parameters per model are constants for a given $K$, and for large $K$, work is overwhelmingly dominated by the number of possible candidate models (models are trivially parallelizable), we believe that scaling will not be difficult as the number of available processors increases.

# Abstract

In order to effectively manage exploited populations, accurate estimates of commercial fisheries catches are necessary to inform monitoring and assessment efforts.
In California, the high degree of heterogeneity in the species composition of many groundfish fisheries, particularly those targeting rockfish (Sebastes), leads to challenges in sampling all market categories, or species, adequately. 
Limited resources and increasingly complex stratification of the sampling system inevitably leads to gaps in sample data. 
In the presence of sampling gaps, ad-hoc species composition point estimation is currently obtained according to historically derived “data borrowing” protocols which do not allow for uncertainty estimation or forecasting. 
In order to move from the current ad-hoc "data-borrowing" design-based point estimators, we have constructed Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate species compositions, complete with accurate measures of uncertainty, as well as theoretically sound out-of-sample predictions.
Furthermore, we introduce a computational method for discovering consistent “borrowing” strategies across overstratified data.
Our modeling approach, along with a computationally robust system of inference and model exploration, allows us to start to understand the affect of the complexly stratified, and sparse, sampling system, on the kinds of inference possible, while simultaneously making the most from the available data.

*Our  results  indicate  that this  approach  is  likely  to  be  more  robust  than  the  current  system,  particularly  in  the  face  of  sparse  sampling. 
Additionally,  our  method  should  also  help inform,  and prioritize,  future  sampling  efforts.
Perhaps  more  significantly,  this  approach  provides estimates of uncertainty around species-specific catch estimates.*

In the present sample-based methodology, data is required in each unique stratification of the system to obtain any inference.
Given the complex, and numerous, stratification of this system, many stratum do not have observations, and thus inference is not possible with out some sort of pooling of stratum.
Pooling data will naturally increase the bias of the resulting estimates, but when no other data is available a slightly biased estimate is better than no estimate at all.
In the current state of affairs, a "historically" derived set of pooling rules have been implemented across ports, so as to theoretically minimize any biased introduced thru pooling ports, the basis for which ports are similar is hard to explicitly quantify as it is largely based on personal experience.

as a function of the number of discrete items to be pooled $K$.
The total number to be considered is
