	title = {A least squares approach to analyzing catch at age data.},
	volume = {12},
	abstract = {The historical mackerel fishery off the northeastern United States coast from 1604 to 1974 is reviewed, with particular emphasis on recent international catches which increased from 1,049 tons in 1962 to a peak of 387,364 tons in 1972. Changes in mackerel abundance during 1963-75 are described by four research vessel survey and commercial fishery indices. These are evaluated in terms of similarity to biomass estimates based on results of virtual population analysis (VPA). The VPA estimates increased from 1968 to 1970 and then declined thereafter. The US spring survey catch per tow index indicated a 92\% decline in abundance from 1968 to 1975. The autumn survey index increased from 1963 to 1967 and then showed an 80\% decline in abundance from 1967 to 1973-74. The US commercial standardized catch per day index increased steadily until 1968 and then declined by 94\% to 1974. The distant water fleet (DWF) standardized catch per hour index increased from 1968 to 1970, declined in 1971-72, and then increased in 1973-74. Analyses suggested that changes in DWF vessel efficiency occurred during 1968-74 due to learning or technological improvements, or both. It was concluded that the US commercial index and the spring survey index were better indicators of changes in mackerel abundance than the DWF index.},

	abstract = {The California Current System (CCS) is forced by the distribution of atmospheric pressure and associated winds in relation to the west coast of North America. In this paper, we begin with a simplified case of winds and a linear coast, then consider variability characteristic of the CCS, and conclude by considering future change. The CCS extends from the North Pacific Current (∼50°N) to off Baja California, Mexico (∼15–25°N) with a major discontinuity at Point Conception (34.5°N). Variation in atmospheric pressure affects winds and thus upwelling. Coastal, wind-driven upwelling results in nutrification and biological production and a southward coastal jet. Offshore, curl-driven upwelling results in a spatially large, productive habitat. The California Current flows equatorward and derives from the North Pacific Current and the coastal jet. Dominant modes of spatial and temporal variability in physical processes and biological responses are discussed. High surface production results in deep and bottom waters depleted in oxygen and enriched in carbon dioxide. Fishing has depleted demersal stocks more than pelagic stocks, and marine mammals, including whales, are recovering. Krill, squid, and micronekton are poorly known and merit study. Future climate change will differ from past change and thus prediction of the CCS requires an understanding of its dynamics. Of particular concern are changes in winds, stratification, and ocean chemistry.},

	abstract = {The Gulf of California (GC) is one of the most historically important regions in Mexico for shark fisheries. However, detailed historical shark landings are not available, making it difficult to plan adequate management strategies. This study analyses historical trends in GC shark fishery landings in a data-poor environment to establish a baseline for future research and assessments. The total shark landings for the artisanal fishery from 1939 to 2014, middle-size vessel fishery landings for the 1988–2014, and species composition from 1960 to 2014 were estimated, and we assessed the uncertainty inherent in the data sources and subsequent analyses. Thirty-eight shark species were identified in the GC artisanal fishery, of which Mustelus spp., Sphyrna lewini, Rhizoprionodon longurio, Squatina californica, Carcharhinus falciformis, Sphyrna zygaena, and Carcharhinus limbatus were the taxa with the greatest landings. A noticeable decline in landings was observed for Carcharhinus leucas, Nasolamia velox, Negaprion brevirostris, Sphyrna spp., Carcharhinus altimus, Carcharhinus obscurus, Galeocerdo cuvier, Carcharhinus porosus, Triakis semifasciata, and Carcharhinus brachyurus. Landings of the pelagic sharks Prionace glauca, Alopias pelagicus, and Isurus oxyrinchus increased after 1986, mainly due to the development of the middle-size vessel fishery. The history of GC shark fisheries and implications for management of sustainable shark fisheries are discussed.},

Data collected from anglers through MRIP supply fisheries managers with essential information for assessing fish stocks. In 2006, the National Research Council provided an evaluation of MRIPâ€™s predecessor, the Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS). That review, Review of Recreational Fisheries Survey Methods, presented conclusions and recommendations in six categories: sampling issues; statistical estimation issues; human dimensions; program management and support; communication and outreach; and general recommendations. After spending nearly a decade addressing the recommendations, NMFS requested another evaluation of its modified survey program (MRIP). This report, the result of that evaluation, serves as a 10-year progress report. It recognizes the progress that NMFS has made, including major improvements in the statistical soundness of its survey designs, and also highlights some remaining challenges and provides recommendations for addressing them.},

The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},

	abstract = {Standard statistical practice ignores model uncertainty. Data analysts typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed as if the selected model had generated the data. This approach ignores the uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-confident inferences and decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) provides a coherent mechanism for accounting for this model uncertainty. Several methods for implementing BMA have recently emerged. We discuss these methods and present a number of examples. In these examples, BMA provides improved out-of-sample predictive performance. We also provide a catalogue of currently available BMA software.},

	abstract = {The primary purpose of this paper is to describe the seasonal variation of the various currents which comprise the California Current System—the California Current, the California Undercurrent, the Davidson Current and the Southern California Countercurrent—and to investigate qualitatively the dynamical relationships among these currents. Although the majority of information was derived from existing literature, previously unpublished data are introduced to provide direct evidence for the existence of a jet-like Undercurrent over the continental slope off Washington, to illustrate ‘event’-scale fluctuations in the Undercurrent and to investigate the existence of the Undercurrent during the winter season. The existing literature is thoroughly reviewed and synthesized. In addition, and more important, geostrophic velocities are computed along several sections from the Columbia River to Cape San Lazaro from dynamic heights given by Wyllie (1966), Budinger, Coachman and Barnes (1964), and Reed and Halpern (1976). From these data and from long-term monthly wind stress data and vertical component of wind stress curl data (denoted curl τ) given by Nelson (1977), interesting new conclusions are made. 1. The flow that has been denoted the California Current generally has both an offshore and a nearshore maximum in its alongshore coponent. 2. The seasonal variation of the nearshore region of strong flow appears to be related to the seasonal variation of the alongshore component of wind stress at the coast, τyN, at all latitudes. Curl τ near the coast may also contribute to the seasonal signal, accounting for the lead of maximum current over maximum wind stress from about 40°N northward. Large-scale flow separation and fall countercurrents that of headlands may account for the sudden occurrence of late summer and fall countercurrents that appear as large anomalies from the wind-driven coastal flow south of 40°N. 3. From Cape Mendocino southward a northward mean is imposed on the nearshore current distribution. The mean is largest where curl τ is locally strongest, in particular, off and south of San Francisco and in the California Bight. It may be responsible for the portion of the Davidson Current that occurs off California, for the San Francisco Eddy and for the Southern California Eddy or Countercurrent. When southward wind stress weakens in these regions, the northward mean dominates the flow. Flow separation in the vicinity of headlands may also be responsible for these northward flows. There is some evidence that during periods of northward flow a mean monthly τyN-driven southward current occurs inshore of the mean northward flow. At all latitudes, wind-driven ‘event’-scale fluctuations are expected to be superimposed on the seasonal nearshore flow. 4. The spatial distribution and seasonal variation oftthe offshore region of southward flow appear to be related to the spatial distribution and seasonal variation of curl τ. The seasonal variation of curl τ in these areas, curl τl, is roughly in phase with the seasonal variation of τy near the coast and roughly 180° out of phase with the seasonal variation of curl τ near the coast. Southward flow lags negative curl τ by from two to four months. The offshore region of southward flow is strongest during the summer and early fall. The mean annual location of the maximum flow is at about 250–350 km from shore off Washington and Oregon, and at 430 km off Cape Mendocino, 270 km off Point Conception and 240 km off northern Baja. The offshore branch of the flow bends shoreward near 30°N, which is consistent with the shoreward extension of the region of negative curl τ, so that by Cape San Lazaro (25°N), a single region of strong flow is observed within 200 km of the coast. 5. A third region of strong southward flow occurs at distances exceeding 500 km from the coast. The spatial distribution of this flow appears to be related to the spatial distribution of curl τ. 6. The mean northward flow known as the Davidson Current consists of two regions in which the forcing may be dynamically different—seaward of the continental slope off Washington and Oregon and between Cape Mendocino and Point Conception, the mean monthly northward currents appear to be related to the occurrence of positive curl τ; along the coast of Oregon and Washington the northward currents are not related to the occurrence of positive curl τ but are consistent with forcing by the mean monthly northward wind stress at the coast. 7. A region of southward flow that is continuous with the California Current to the south is generally maintained off Oregon and parts of Washington during the winter. This southward flow appears to separate the northward-flowing Davidson and Alaskan Currents in some time-dependent region south of Vancouver Island. The banded current structure is consistent with the distribution of curl τ, if southward flow is related to negative curl τ. 8. The seasonal progression of the California Undercurrent may be related both to the seasonal variation of the offshore region of strong flow (hence to curl τl) and to the alongshore component of wind stress at the coast. South of Cape Mendocino a northward mean also seems to be superimposed on the flow. This mean may be related to the occurrence of strong positive curl τ near the coast. Velocities at Undercurrent depths have two maxima, one in late summer and one in winter. The slope Undercurrent is indistinguishable, except by location, from the undercurrent that is observed on the Oregon-Washington continental shelf.},

	abstract = {The shark fin trade is a major driver of shark exploitation in fisheries all over the world, most of which are not managed on a species-specific basis. Species-specific trade information highlights taxa of particular concern and can be used to assess the efficacy of management measures and anticipate emerging threats. The species composition of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, one of the world's largest fin trading hubs, was partially assessed in 1999–2001. We randomly selected and genetically identified fin trimmings (n = 4800), produced during fin processing, from the retail market of Hong Kong in 2014–2015 to assess contemporary species composition of the fin trade. We used nonparametric species estimators to determine that at least 76 species of sharks, batoids, and chimaeras supplied the fin trade and a Bayesian model to determine their relative proportion in the market. The diversity of traded species suggests species substitution could mask depletion of vulnerable species; one-third of identified species are threatened with extinction. The Bayesian model suggested that 8 species each comprised {\textgreater}1\% of the fin trimmings (34.1–64.2\% for blue [Prionace glauca], 0.2–1.2\% for bull [Carcharhinus leucas] and shortfin mako [Isurus oxyrinchus]); thus, trade was skewed to a few globally distributed species. Several other coastal sharks, batoids, and chimaeras are in the trade but poorly managed. Fewer than 10 of the species we modeled have sustainably managed fisheries anywhere in their range, and the most common species in trade, the blue shark, was not among them. Our study and approach serve as a baseline to track changes in composition of species in the fin trade over time to better understand patterns of exploitation and assess the effects of emerging management actions for these animals.},

	title = {A {Bayesian} {Analysis} of {Some} {Nonparametric} {Problems}},
	volume = {1},
	issn = {0090-5364},
	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/2958008},
	abstract = {The Bayesian approach to statistical problems, though fruitful in many ways, has been rather unsuccessful in treating nonparametric problems. This is due primarily to the difficulty in finding workable prior distributions on the parameter space, which in nonparametric ploblems is taken to be a set of probability distributions on a given sample space. There are two desirable properties of a prior distribution for nonparametric problems. (I) The support of the prior distribution should be large--with respect to some suitable topology on the space of probability distributions on the sample space. (II) Posterior distributions given a sample of observations from the true probability distribution should be manageable analytically. These properties are antagonistic in the sense that one may be obtained at the expense of the other. This paper presents a class of prior distributions, called Dirichlet process priors, broad in the sense of (I), for which (II) is realized, and for which treatment of many nonparametric statistical problems may be carried out, yielding results that are comparable to the classical theory. In Section 2, we review the properties of the Dirichlet distribution needed for the description of the Dirichlet process given in Section 3. Briefly, this process may be described as follows. Let X be a space and A a σ-field of subsets, and let α be a finite non-null measure on (X, A). Then a stochastic process P indexed by elements A of A, is said to be a Dirichlet process on (X, A) with parameter α if for any measurable partition (A1, ⋯, Ak) of X, the random vector (P(A1), ⋯, P(Ak)) has a Dirichlet distribution with parameter (α(A1), ⋯, α(Ak)). P may be considered a random probability measure on (X, A), The main theorem states that if P is a Dirichlet process on (X, A) with parameter α, and if X1, ⋯, Xn is a sample from P, then the posterior distribution of P given X1, ⋯, Xn is also a Dirichlet process on (X, A) with a parameter α + ∑n 1 δxi , where δx denotes the measure giving mass one to the point x. In Section 4, an alternative definition of the Dirichlet process is given. This definition exhibits a version of the Dirichlet process that gives probability one to the set of discrete probability measures on (X, A). This is in contrast to Dubins and Freedman [2], whose methods for choosing a distribution function on the interval [0, 1] lead with probability one to singular continuous distributions. Methods of choosing a distribution function on [0, 1] that with probability one is absolutely continuous have been described by Kraft [7]. The general method of choosing a distribution function on [0, 1], described in Section 2 of Kraft and van Eeden [10], can of course be used to define the Dirichlet process on [0, 1]. Special mention must be made of the papers of Freedman and Fabius. Freedman [5] defines a notion of tailfree for a distribution on the set of all probability measures on a countable space X. For a tailfree prior, posterior distribution given a sample from the true probability measure may be fairly easily computed. Fabius [3] extends the notion of tailfree to the case where X is the unit interval [0, 1], but it is clear his extension may be made to cover quite general X. With such an extension, the Dirichlet process would be a special case of a tailfree distribution for which the posterior distribution has a particularly simple form. There are disadvantages to the fact that P chosen by a Dirichlet process is discrete with probability one. These appear mainly because in sampling from a P chosen by a Dirichlet process, we expect eventually to see one observation exactly equal to another. For example, consider the goodness-of-fit problem of testing the hypothesis H0 that a distribution on the interval [0, 1] is uniform. If on the alternative hypothesis we place a Dirichlet process prior with parameter α itself a uniform measure on [0, 1], and if we are given a sample of size n ≥ 2, the only nontrivial nonrandomized Bayes rule is to reject H0 if and only if two or more of the observations are exactly equal. This is really a test of the hypothesis that a distribution is continuous against the hypothesis that it is discrete. Thus, there is still a need for a prior that chooses a continuous distribution with probability one and yet satisfies properties (I) and (II). Some applications in which the possible doubling up of the values of the observations plays no essential role are presented in Section 5. These include the estimation of a distribution function, of a mean, of quantiles, of a variance and of a covariance. A two-sample problem is considered in which the Mann-Whitney statistic, equivalent to the rank-sum statistic, appears naturally. A decision theoretic upper tolerance limit for a quantile is also treated. Finally, a hypothesis testing problem concerning a quantile is shown to yield the sign test. In each of these problems, useful ways of combining prior information with the statistical observations appear. Other applications exist. In his Ph. D. dissertation [1], Charles Antoniak finds a need to consider mixtures of Dirichlet processes. He treats several problems, including the estimation of a mixing distribution, bio-assay, empirical Bayes problems, and discrimination problems.},
